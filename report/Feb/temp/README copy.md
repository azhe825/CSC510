# Best-Practice-SE-text-mining

For BIGDSE ’16

## Notes

- Understand the relevance of SE processes for ML/Big Data
- There has been a constant push for using ML in SE. But, what about SE for ML
- We'd like to explore what SE can teach ML

- Big data and ML practitioners have an variety of tools at their disposal, with the growing size of such requires a validation team.
- Mythical man month - 1/2 of the time is used of testing 
- Coding takes only 1/6th the entire time.

- Industrial data mining has taught us that the significance of goal of a certain task
- Key take way: Your goals are not my goals.

### DM at LN
- The problem is indeed unique. No dearth of data, but labeling data is quite expensive
- Emulating real world data is hard — forum such as stack exchange can be used to address these issues.
- TAR is primarily a binary classification task.
- StackEx using a site level granularity produces a satisfactory analogy to the real problem in hand.
- Binary classification of this sort is vastly different from other techniques. This enables us to take to shortcuts. 
- These lessons are by no means general, we only endeavor to highlight the challenges in industrial data mining.

### Experiments
 - Best Decision
 - All other decisons comparing with the best one

### Discusions
 - some words to justify the best decision
 - lessons learnt from this project
 - The role of validation teams:
   - Mining large industrial data has signification lessons that can be learnt from SE practices
 - validity threats

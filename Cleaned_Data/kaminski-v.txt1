asking for a favour but im not sure ifhe isthere in houston i know that you guys are probably very busy but i waswondering if you can write a few sentences for me im sending out somesample chapters to the people who responded positively all of them to myrequest for some feedback on the book chapter has an overview of thebook with just a couple of sentences on each chapter could you pleasewrite a sentence or two for your chapterim including what i have already written although i think it has changedslightly from this version so that you can see the stylemany thanks and best regardschris overview of this bookthis book aims to provide an indepth understanding of the pricing and riskmanagement of energy derivatives in the remainder of this chapter we givean overview of the fundamental principals needed to model and price energyassets and which underlie the rest of the book as well as introducingthe techniques that underlie the blackscholes modelling framework wediscuss the numerical techniques of trinomial trees and monte carlosimulation for derivative pricing which are used extensively later in thebookin chapter we analyse spot energy prices apart from describingempirical prices we propose a number of processes that can be used to modelthe prices we look at the wellknow process of gbm as well as meanreversion stochastic volatility and jump processes discussing each andshowing how they can be simulated and their parameters estimatedchapter written by vince kaminski grant masson and ronnie chahal of enron corporation discusses volatility estimation in energy commodity markets this chapter builds on the previous one it examines in detailthe methods merits and pitfalls of the volatility estimation process assuming different pricing models introduced in chapter examples from crude gas and electricity markets are used to illustrate the technical and interpretative aspects of calculating volatilitychapter examines forward curves in the energy markets although suchcurves are well understood and straight forward in the world debt marketsthe difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well definedcurves what we do in this chapterchapter presents an overview of the common and notsocommon derivativestructures in the energy markets and discusses their uses examples ofproducts analysed in this chapter include a variety of swaps caps floorsand collars as well as energy swaptions compound options asian oraverage rate options barriers lookbacks and ladder optionschapter investigates single and multifactor models of the energy spotprice and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives closed formsolutions for forward prices forward volatilities and european optionprices are derived and presented for all the models in this chapterincluding a three factor stochastic convenience yield and interest ratemodel with jumpschapter shows how the prices of path dependent and american style optionscan be evaluated for the models in chapter simulation schemes aredeveloped for the evaluation of european style options and applied to avariety of path dependent options in order to price options whichincorporate early exercise opportunities a trinomial tree scheme isdeveloped this tree is built to be consistent with the observed forwardcurve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard american styleoptionschapter develops a new methodology for valuing energy options based onmodelling the market observed forward curve the approach results in amultifactor model that is able to capture realistically the evolution of awide range of energy forward curves and where the user defined volatilitystructures can be of an extremely general form closedform solutions aredeveloped for pricing standard european options and efficient monte carloschemes for exotic options the chapter finishes with a discussion of thevaluation of american style optionschapter focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positionsin this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutionsthat sell options or other derivatives to a client and who is then facedwith the problem of managing the risk through time we begin with deltahedging a portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gammahedging using the models from chapters and the general model ofchapter ideally suited to multifactor hedging and this is alsodiscussedchapter looks at the key riskmanagement concept of value at riskapplied to portfolios containing energy derivative portfolios afterdiscussing the concept of the measure we look at how the key inputsvolatilities covariances correlations etc can be estimated we thencompare the fours major methodologies for computing var

which is below and if you want to review change or rewrite thepreface that would be very appreciated let me know what your thoughts arethanksjuliewere getting closeprefaceone of our main objectives in writing energy derivatives pricing and riskmanagement has been to bring together as many of the various approaches for thepricing and risk management energy derivatives as possible to discuss indepththe models and to show how they relate to each other in this way we hope tohelp the reader to analyse the different models price a wide range of energyderivatives or to build a risk management system which uses a consistentmodelling framework we believe that for practitioners this last point is veryimportant and we continue to stress in our articles and presentations thedangers of having flawed risk management and giving arbitrage opportunities toyour competitors by using adhoc and inconsistent models for differentinstruments and markets see also others who propose consistent modelshowever it is not our wish to concentrate on one particular model or modelsat the exclusion of the others because we believe that the choice should restwith the user although it will probably be clear from our discussions themodels we prefer we therefore try and give as clear account as possibleof the advantage and disadvantages of all the models so that the reader canmake an informed choice as to the models which best suit their needsin order to meet our objectives the book is divided into chapters inchapter we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model andprice energy derivatives which will underpin the remainder of the book inaddition to introducing the techniques that underlie the blackscholesmodelling framework we outline the numerical techniques of trinomial trees andmonte carlo simulation for derivative pricing which are used throughout thebookin chapter we discuss the analysis of spot energy prices as well asanalysing empirical price movements we propose a number of processes that canbe used to model the prices we look at the wellknow process of geometricbrownian motion as well as mean reversion stochastic volatility and jumpprocesses

australia ::::::>>>>>> preface for book vince hope you are well we spoke a while ago about who should write the preface for the book and you kindly offered that you would provide this is this still possible we realise that you are extremely busy so chris and les went ahead and wrote something which is below and if you want to review change or rewritet he preface that would be very appreciated let me know what your thoughts a re thanks julie were getting close preface one of our main objectives in writing energy derivatives pricing and risk management has been to bring together as many of the various approaches fo r the pricing and risk management energy derivatives as possible to discuss indepth the models and to show how they relate to each other in this way we hope to help the reader to analyse the different models price a wid e range of energy derivatives or to build a risk management system which use s a consistent modelling framework we believe that for practitioners this last point is very important and we continue to stress in our articles and presentations the dangers of having flawed risk management and giving arbitrage opportunities to your competitors by using adhoc and inconsiste nt models for different instruments and markets see also others who propose consistent models however it is not our wish to concentrate on one particular model or models at the exclusion of the others because we believe that the choice should rest with the user although it will probab ly be clear from our discussions the models we prefer we therefore try a nd give as clear account as possible of the advantage and disadvantages of al l the models so that the reader can make an informed choice as to the models which best suit their needs in order to meet our objectives the book is divided into chapters in chapter we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to mode l and price energy derivatives which will underpin the remainder of the book in addition to introducing the techniques that underlie the blackscholes modelling framework we outline the numerical techniques of trinomial trees and monte carlo simulation for derivative pricing which are used througho ut the book in chapter we discuss the analysis of spot energy prices as well as analysing empirical price movements we propose a number of processes that can be used to model the prices we look at the wellknow process of geometric brownian motion as well as mean reversion stochastic volatility and jump processes discussing each and showing how they can be simulated and their

presented a review of progress made in the implementation of the eu gas directive during a twoday workshop held by th e european commission and the world bank in paris in november many of these countries have been reforming their energy industries throughout the s as part of their transition to a market economy the results have been mixed particularly in the utility industries the g as directive adopted in august now offers a compelling incentive for eu candidate countries to transform their gas industries while providing a ro ad map to guide them the critical points relevant to harmonization between the european union an d candidate countries include the following legal framework and regulation the legal framework is the cornerstone of enlargement and the yardstick of harmonization in europe as a result in a ll candidate countries in energy laws were either updated or newl y established along the principles spelled out in the gas directive regulato ry bodies have been created by law and are operating in every country althoug h issues of staffing financial autonomy and independence from political influence are not uniformly resolved thirdparty access tpa and longterm takeorpay contracts all candida te countries agree that tpa is a key to market competition therefore all hav e adopted it or intend to do so in their new legislation although the commission favors regulated tpa the specific approaches to tpa enforcement in the candidate countries remain unclear in some cases in particular the implementation of tpa will have to address the issue of longterm takeorp ay contracts with russia that were signed by all major domestic gas companies and somewhat preempt competition russian gas is for the most part sold to single traditional stateowned operators that dominate their internal markets a balance will need to be struck between these incumbent dominant players and the competitive environment this is made more complicated by their ownership of large volumes of russian gas supplied in kind in exchang e for transit rights to west european customers article of the directive provides for a derogation to companies experiencing difficulties stemming from takeorp ay obligations this derogation would apply to the companies of candidate countries with historical and commercial links with the russian gas industr y furthermore article allows derogations to those member states with only one major gas supplier to those with an emerging gas mar ket status or to those without a direct gas connection to the grid of another member state most of the candidate countries would in principle be able to call on one or more of these grounds for derogation when they join the european union price crosssubsidies residential gas tariffs are artificially low and a re financed partially through higher rates applied to industrial consumers in various countries tariff increases and the phasing out of subsidies have been scheduled but such decisions remain politically sensitive to enforce this has recently been emphasized by high gas prices owing to the linkage o f imported gas to oil prices all candidate countries have set legal framewor ks that include the phasing out of crosssubsidies as part of sector reform b ut the actual implementation will remain politically difficult as table indicates price rebalancing is already under way in most countries expecte d to enter the european union by middecade but the legal framework itself cannot guarantee the pace of reform the same goes for candidate countries that have only recently introduced eucomplying energy laws and whose entry to the european union is likely to happen in a longer time frame unbundling most countries understand that the unbundling of transmission companies from their supply businesses is the second critical element of liberalization to date unbundling the accounts of these two businesses is all that has been adopted by the member states or in the candidate countrie s in the future the commission is likely to press all eu countries for legal separation structural unbundling of the businesses and candidate countries will have to pursue their reform of the gas sector accordingly table gives an overview of the state of play in candidate countries as t he table shows the countries belonging to the second group have only very recently undertaken the reform of the gas sector in accordance with the directive whereas change had been introduced earlier in the countries scheduled for the first wave end follow above url for full

cera ::::::>>>>>> cera monthly oil briefing cera alert december title cera monthly oil briefing fundamentals update email category cera monthly briefing cera knowledge area world oil in the past two weeks oil prices have sold off the premium or price strength that had been built into the market in anticipation of possible shortages this winter the exact cause of the sharp switch in market psychology is hard to pinpoint but seems to be a combination of very early signs that the oil stock situation is at least stabilizing even if stocks have not built substantially and that thus far despite a few weeks of colderthannormal temperatures heating oil supply has been adequate to meet demand in the key us market that has allayed some of the concerns that were driving speculative interest into the market furthermore the potential for weakness in the us economy may be creating expectations for weaker oil demand in the change in market psychology was dramatically illustrated when news that iraq was cutting off exports caused prices to slide yet the iraqi export cutoff is having a concrete effect on fundamentals if the cutoff lasts through december the effect will be pronouncedit would turn a projected fourth quarter stockbuild of million barrels per day mbd into a stockdraw of mbd we expect iraqi production levels to remain erratic because of its dispute with the un security council over sanctions and exports may again cease at some point such a development would have a price supportive effect ceras price outlook for remains the same as that in the world oil watch released in late november assuming normal winter weather and no prolonged or repeated shutdowns of iraqi production the projected average for first quarter is per barrel for wti however this outlook is based on opecs announcing an agreement early in the first quarter to cut its production by the start of the second quarter a failure to restrain output would result in a downward adjustment to an average of wti for the first quarter of with prices lower in the second half of the quarter than in the first the downward pressure results from the prospect of a largerthanusual implied build in stocks during the second quarter of about mbdwith a cut in opec outputiraq in a twilight zone as anticipated iraq ceased exporting oil under the uncontrolled oil for food program as of december in protest over the rejection by the security councils sanctions committee of its proposed december export price scheduleiraqs pricing was judged by the un overseers who monitor the export program and advise the sanctions committee to be about cents per barrel below comparable crudes in an apparent attempt to offset an illicit surcharge that iraq was seeking from buyersalthough the standoff with the sanctions committee continues iraq partially resumed exporting on december since then about mbd has been exported from the mina albakr terminal in the persian gulf prior to the shutdown iraqi exports under un auspices were at a rate of mbd for november as compared with mbd for the third quarter exports for november were about mbd from mina albakr and about mbd from ceyhan in the mediterranean exports from ceyhan have not resumed owing to the surcharge dispute with the result that about mbd of iraqi crude remains off the marketiraqs semishutdown has put it into a kind of twilight zone while its dispute with the sanctions committee over pricing continues in the midst of this dispute the un security council approved phase nine of the oilforfood program at the last minute on december it became effective on december and has been accepted by iraq as of december iraqs revised export price for ceyhan proposed for the remainder of december has again been judged too low by the overseers and is expected to be rejected by the sanctions committee additionally the overseers have notified lifters of iraqi crude that any oil payment made directly to iraq rather than to the un escrow account would be a violation of un sanctions buyers of iraqi oil from mina albakr have consistently been reported as saying that they are not paying a surcharge to iraqhow long iraq may operate at about half capacity is unclear but it continues to request a surcharge payment from prospective lifters at ceyhan in an apparent effort to circumvent and degrade the un financial controls that are the heart of the sanctions system the distinction that iraq has made between mina albakr and ceyhan arose when it resumed operations at mina albakr by loading two cargoes for the india oil company iraq may have judged this accommodation to be in its interest since it recently also signed an oil exploration contract with india under which payments would be made in oil as currently structured the deal would violate un sanctions but india is seeking an exception from the security council on grounds of economic hardship the exception seems unlikely to be granted which may lead iraq to cease exports from mina albakr againthere are many possible scenarios that iraq could follow but we expect uncertainty about iraqi exports to continue as iraq uses its oil exports as leverage to undermine sanctions in its ongoing struggle with the security council to end all restraints consequently the iraq factor will remain an element in the oil price outlook iraqs antisanctions campaign has also raised the visibility of the iraq issue in washington as the incoming bush administration prepares to take office secretary of statedesignate colin powell has already acknowledged a need to reassess iraq policy and has said that he would work to reenergize sanctions the iraq issue is being debated in virtually every foreign policyoriented think tank in washington a consensus seems to be emerging around seeking renewed international support and legitimacy for sanctions by retaining un control over iraqs oil revenue and strictly enforcing a prohibition on sales of weapons and related material while lifting general trade controls that increasingly are both ineffective and an international irritant there is virtually no sentiment in favor of operations to destabilize or remove the saddam hussein regime on the pragmatic basis that the prospects for success are remotedemand trends record high us natural gas prices have increased the economic incentive for gas consumers with the capability to switch from gas to distillate to do so and reports of switching are emerging in a number of areas interruptible gas customers with resid or distillate fuel backup have already switched to oil so it is now firm gas supply customers with the potential to add to the already high level of distillate demand so far in december us distillate demand is running at a record high december level of mbd however only a small portion of this demand is the result of economically based fuelswitching from gas to distillate cera estimates that the additional demand likely to come from further switching of gas to distillate is relatively small on the order of to mbd in ceras view it is likely that only a portion of the theoretical capacity will be switched on short notice because in some cases this theoretically switchable capacity has not been used in recent years and tankage and delivery infrastructure may be in uncertain condition switching by interruptible gas customers such as utilities to distillate began about a month or more ago although the volumes involved are relatively small switching to residual fuel already occurred months ago when gas prices started to surge in the summer a portion of the us secondary and tertiary distillate stockbuild seen this autumn was likely prompted by interruptible gas customers filling their reserve distillate fuel storage given the expectations of a tight gas market regulators have been explicit about enforcing backup fuel storage requirements in the months leading up to the current heating season other end users of natural gas have few or no options for fuel switching some ammonia and ethane producers have shut down operations because the cost of feedstock natural gas is high natural gas is also used in some enhanced oil recovery operations and some of these producers have also opted to sell gas back to the grid rather than produce oil supply trends nonopec supply for the fourth quarter is expected to be up mbd over a year earlier at mbd recent events include a shortfall in mexican production curtailed in october by about bd owing to the effects of hurricane keith mexicos fourth quarter liquids production is expected to be mbdabout percent of mexican liquids capacity norways output increased bd from october to november as maintenance season ended norways production for the fourth quarter is expected to be mbdgrowing russian crude oil production throughout the year is supporting a recent surge in exports in spite of higher export taxes russian exports of domestic oil production excluding transit volumes reached mbd in november after remaining fairly steady at about mbd from july though october fourth quarter oil exports are expected to average mbd mbd greater than in the fourth quarter cera estimates iraqi oil production averaged mbd in novemberdown mbd from the october level the cutoff in exports earlier this month reduced iraqi output for the first days of december to roughly mbd iraq resumed exports of about mbd on december which raised production to mbd assuming no change in iraqs current production stance iraqi production would average mbd for december on a quarterly basis the decline in iraq output would lead to estimated opec output in the fourth quarter of mbd and would turn an estimated global oil stockbuild of mbd into a stockdraw of mbd these production estimates include mbd of crude oil exports to syria that began on november without un authorization and are continuingoil stocks us crude oil inventories doe data have climbed intermittently from an annual low of million barrels in september and reached million barrels in middecember see figure since prices weakened in late november crude oil stocks have stabilized above the annual low in september and the ranges seen in october to levels from million barrelsprimary inventories of us heating oil remain well below yearearlier levels at million barrels they are million barrels or percent less than those of a year ago but there are indications of builds in secondary and tertiary inventories we estimate that wholesale and consumer stocks are up million barrels since august and are actually higher than they were at the end of last yearin europe crude oil stocks are at more comfortable levels when compared with those of the united states in november stocks rose nearly million barrels to million barrels at this

cera ::::::>>>>>> access on the block international transmission auctions cera a lert december title access on the block international transmission auctions are opening european power markets email category cera insight cera knowledge area european power despite an apparent impasse in negotiations among european transmission system operators regulators and the european commission in florence auctions of international transmission capacity itc in france the united kingdom denmark belgium italy austria switzerland slovenia and the netherlands are opening access between countries and paving the way for the single european marketplacehowever the patchwork auctioning of access to itc leaves important issues unresolved the most significant of these include the potential for gaming thirdparty transit and the allocation of auction proceeds as they stand these issues cera believes are likely to lead to action at the european level and the eventual imposition of a more integrated schemenevertheless current plans to open most of europes itc represent a watershed of activity that will hasten transparency in the market and determine trade flows and signal transmission investment in international auctions are opening markets a major portion of international transmission capacity on the continent will be allocated by auction in see table in ceras view auctions for itc are likely to have the greatest impact during in the following areas increasing market transparency the posting of available transmission capacity on yearly monthly and daily bases will facilitate the markets efficient usage of scarce interconnector capacity for the first time signals for new transmission investment power flows and transmission asset valuation will come from the market increasing crossborder trade although auctions may not reduce uncertainty in the marketplace initially the effect of heightened transparency in access rules and prices will soon work to increase trade secondary markets for interconnector capacity will add to the number of actively traded power products and work to increase the overall level of trade increasing price correlation auctions will replace nonmarketbased allocation methods such as longterm capacity reservation the dynamic character of shorterterm auctions combined with an expected secondary market for capacity should bring access to international capacity in line with the needs of the market in this way the market will be able to adjust more rapidly to changes in local conditions and thereby work to correlate pricing points increasing competition once players have secured access to itc at a given price they will be looking to sign supply contracts or integrate the capacity into structured deals the result could be more aggressive maneuvering on the part of incumbents and new entrants alike resulting in greater competition at the national level reducing the competitiveness of imports the results of international transmission capacity auctions will determine the competitiveness of imported power into domestic markets final prices offered for itc will reflect the relative cost of power between markets and work to make cheaper power more expensive to import spurring investment in transmission the money raised through auction could provide transmission companies with the financial capability to invest in upgrading international transmission links access to international transmission capacity between the netherlands germany and belgium in was auctioned for million euros see httpwwwtsoauctionorg for details auctions for access into spain france and italy are expected to realize a premium for access to highly coveted markets connecting rather than integrating markets auctions between national grids or more accurately commercial grids are a pragmatic approach to the problem of granting access to scarce international transmission capacity on an open and transparent basis the auctions will open access to interconnectors and at the same time reward transmission system operatorseven so the proposed approaches are not likely to satisfy market players or the stated objectives of european policymakers in ceras view the following issues may eventually bring down the hammer on itc auctions thirdparty transit the bilateral nature of itc auctions perpetrates the problem of tariff pancaking and discriminates against trade involving transit through a third grid this is ultimately inconsistent with the european commissions objective of a single european power market the fact that physical power flows do not follow contractual flows and almost always transit thirdparty grids further weakens the legitimacy of the approach transactionbased scheme although still transactional in nature tied to a specific deal auctions fall within the european commissions stated preference for marketbased mechanisms for allocating international transmission capacity it remains to be seen how successful this approach is in achieving integration of national markets action at the european level could move allocation of itc in the direction of nontransactional mechanisms such as market splitting counter trading or redispatching gaming of auctions auctions will in theory allocate access to transmission on a nondiscriminatory market basis to those that value it most in practice it remains to be seen if gaming can be avoided even though most of the auctions have placed limits on ownership of transmission capacity tactical maneuvers could bid up transmission prices as players act to raise the price of imported power allocating auction proceeds one likely outcome of auctions will be the transfer of profits between players as transmission owners recoup some of the rents currently reaped by other players this will works to raise the value of transmission assets relative to generation suppliers or traders it remains to be seen how funds from auctions will be allocated among transmission companies and the grid as transmission is still currently subject to monopoly regulationend come shoot the rapids with us at ceraweek shooting the rapids strategies and risks for

gasoline demand to continue to decline seasonally as colder temperatures arrive averaging mbd during the first quarter of reported distillate apparent demand remains exceptionally strong at mbd for the four weeks ending december over percent greater than this time last year this represents a slight increase of about million barrels mb from the endoctober level of mb but still a record high level

the coming winter months averaging mb during the first quarter of next year apparent demand for jet fuel declined by percent from the october level to reach mbd for the four weeks ending december despite the decline apparent jet fuel demand is over percent above the yearago level the relative strength of jet fuel reported demand continues to parallel distillate demand strength with support

apparent demand forward supply coverage of gasoline climbed to days for the four weeks ending december forward supply is percent below last years level at this time of year and at its lowest level in the past eight yearsalthough cera still believes coverage is currently sufficient for the level of demand expected this winter however cera is looking cautiously at the implications of high distillate refinery yields and production because of the possibility of low gasoline inventories at the start of the driving season in the second quarter of next year distillate inventory coverage has remained about level since the end of october at days of forward supply for the four weeks ending december despite record high apparent demand strong refinery production levels helped boost primary distillate inventories slightly to mb for this period primary stocks are percent below last years level at this time and at their lowest historical level ever although stocks are low cera does not anticipate shortages to occur this winter assuming normally cold weather refinery production and net imports are expected to be capable of meeting demand requirementsalbeit at a high price jet fuel inventory coverage crept upward by about day of coverage to reach days of forward supply for the four weeks ending december this moves jet fuel coverage above the to days supply range that it had been in for the past four months the rise of just under day in forward supply was mainly a response to a decline in apparent demand jet inventories and coverage are expected to become tighter in the coming weeks as the pull from tight distillate markets strengthen but supplies are expected to be adequate for the winter inventory coverage of residual fuel rose by almost days of forward supply from october reaching days of forward supply during the four weeks ending december the increase in coverage was a temporary response to a drop in demand and an increase in stocks with demand expected to strengthen

cera ::::::>>>>>> california on the brinkcera alert cera alert december title california on the brink cera knowledge areas western energy n american power n american gas california on the brink the california stalemate california moved closer to the brink of an outage today as concerns over creditworthiness of buyers brought the possibility that generators would avoid selling to the california market while numerous factors have contributed to the high cost of power incurred by californias utilities the root cause of the current crisis is a lack of new generation the current credit crisis and its threat to supplies could spark state action to address the situation the collective efforts of all market participants should be focused on increasing generation capacity as quickly as possiblewestern power prices have skyrocketed well beyond the record levels set this summer perhaps because frozen rates insulate the majority of california consumers and companies from tangible effects of the market crisis regulators have been able to postpone meaningful market reforms and significant rate increases the california public utilities commission denied the requests of pacific gas electric and southern california edison to end their rate freezes forcing these utilities at least temporarily to finance the costs of higher wholesale energy this has created an unsustainable accumulation of costs and a loss of faith in the california market the current credit crisis and the potential for blackouts may become the galvanizing events that provide state regulators with a public mandate to address the underlying structural problems in the industry however there is no guarantee that these regulatory actions will expedite an effective solution for customers and the industry as a whole wholesale and retail markets that emerge from regulatory intervention are likely to remain muddled in the necessarily political process that will follow it is possible thatas has largely been the case so farthe steps taken will fail to move the california power market toward a more enduring solution and will instead continue to mask the underlying structural flaws in the six months since californias supply shortfall began plaguing western markets regulators have done little to address the underlying problem rather than addressing the cause of the supply shortageestablishing a market environment that encourages timely additions of new generating capacity and demand side responsesefforts are instead directed at trying to lay blame for the crisis and lessen the immediate financial impact on customers indeed several actions taken thus far have served more to compound the problem by discouraging new power plant additions these include price caps repeated changes to market rules attempts to seize generator profits and a challenging siting and permitting processmedicine worse than the illness several years of electricity demand growth and low prices in california were accompanied by very few additions to the supply base regulators did not pay adequate attention to the looming supply shortfall the void of consensus over the cause of the current crisis has instead been replaced by a series of bandaid remedies that address the symptoms but not the cause of californias electric market woes challenging siting and permitting despite state action to better coordinate the siting and permitting process for new power plants power plant developers still face high hurdles local community opposition alone has struck down some key proposed facilities price caps discourage investment state and federal proposals to cap prices limit the attractiveness of the california wholesale power market especially for developers who have the option of channeling scarce capital and equipment to more stable or more attractive markets outside the state repeated rule changes frequent rule changes in the iso markets including the price caps confound attempts by developers to estimate profits from new plant development calls for refunds despite reports by the power exchange the iso and the ferc that no pattern of abuse could be found from their examination of the california markets state officials continue to accuse power providers of gaming the market calls by state officials for refunds of generator profits are a threat to new plant development facility inspections recent inspections of power plants by state officials to verify that operators are honestly reporting the operational status of their generating units accentuates the atmosphere of mistrustceras recent analysis suggests that merchant plant developers in the west are not guaranteed to make a profit prospects of new plant profitability are affected by the timing and quantity of new plants decommissioning of older units demand growth and numerous other difficulttoforecast factors californias regulatory actions only further cloud the assessment of financial viability and degrade the political environment for developers considering entering the state despite efforts by the california iso to stimulate new capacity additions in the state with a special limitedterm capacity payment cera estimates that demand growth will continue to outstrip supply additions in the west in in addition the existing siting and permitting process will prevent a sufficient quantity of capacity from entering the market until at the earliest therefore three years remain before a sufficient quantity of capacity enters service to significantly dampen prices and decrease the risk of an outage the road to recovery there are a number of actions that can be taken to help relieve the capacity shortfall encourage new build supply must be part of the answer this requires a series of steps that can help facilitate new supply build while in principal some have been taken such as new fast track approval the success of these actions can only be measured by the build itself for now there is still not enough new supply coming on until to relieve supply tightness stabilize investment climate utilities must have assurance that they will ultimately be allowed to recover market costs for power this provides the credit worthiness needed by sellers to produce energy and to stimulate new build move toward more balanced utility supply portfolios one of the reasons the pressure on customers has been so intense in california has been the absence and even discouragement of diverse supply portfolios among the utilities in the stateparticularly for residential and small commercial customers with the market at a peak however now is in one sense a suboptimal time to move toward term contracting yet these contracts provide the foundation for a series of actionsincluding new supply build and demand side investments if they end up above market they will at least have achieved the desired effect of knocking down prices a fact which by itself should provide sufficient justification for recovering the cost of these commitments encourage market mechanisms that elicit a demand response although originally a feature of californias market design most consumers are insulated from price spikes through capped or frozen retail rates exposing customers to at least some of the market price signals would encourage a demand response encourage market mechanisms that dampen the boom bust characteristic of the market whether in the form of a capacity payment a reserve requirement or a minimum term portfolio requirement the california power market needs to move to a structure that encourages investment in new capacity when the market is in balance rather than waiting for a shortage and price shock to elicit new investment such a structure can help dampen but not eliminate future price volatility avoid continuously tinkering with the market while the market does need to be restructured as described above it also needs to be stable and reliable to encourage the development of new supply as well as a robust longterm contractual market for power in california continually tinkering with the market structuresuch as the three times the price cap has been shifted since julyonly serves to undermine confidence in the market california needs to do its best to develop a longterm solution and then let the market run its course allow for greater environmental flexibility the state should explore a more balanced solution to emissions restrictions in the face of a supply shortfall that has been exacerbated by generators that cannot operate due to emissions restrictions free purpa power plants to generate relief should be granted to purpa power plants that are operational but are restricted by contract from operating to generate

conferences ::::::>>>>>> re real options presentation thanks for the comments grant the presentation is for a couple of external conferences that vince volunteered me for vince has okd the content and stinson raised exactly the same issues as you unfortunately i just dont seem to be getting any response from risk whatsoever on the publication of my article so these conferences will be the public debut for my real options notationof course the discountingrisk neutrality thing is where the real judgement sits when questions arise ill take the line that while research formulates the models using appropriate derivativesmarket based valuation methods we work with our rac group which considers the discounting to be associated with various risks and chooses these rates appropriately the notation makes clear which uncertainties we are exposed to at different stages of the deals which assists in choosing the ratesin practice im not yet at the stage where originators are using my notation yet another reason i cant say too much about its actual use at the conference im producing various tools for deterministic hydro optimization gbm swing option valuation and deterministic dp optimization for genset dispatch which people want right now im working in the background on the kind of modelling my notation demands people are getting to know me as a guy who can solve their immediate problems and theyll be more likely to listen when i start rolling out the proper optionsbased models my notation is currently used only in the specs im writing for the tools im producingill be turning dales spreadsheetbased power plant spread model into an american monte carlo tool which will then be available for inclusion in other models i think by the end of the summer the real options theoretical work will start to bear fruit one year after i initially proposed the notation with the quant it group im cocreating in place i may yet see the automated diagrammingpricing tool made realthanks also for the pointer to tom halliburton the use of the lingo lpinteger package is something ive been presented with for the teesside plant operation optimizer rather than something i chose the perm physical energy risk mgt group just got a couple of analysts to hack it together including natasha danilochkina then asked me to tidy it up when it didnt work they are going to use their existing faulty model for now to meet their project deadlines and im sketching out a proper mathematical spec for the problemive persuaded them that this sort of businesscritical system should be developed properly by research and they now seem happy to fall into line their wilton plant optimizer was developed by one peter morawitz the guy i hoped to recruit into research and they obviously didnt realise he was better than average at quantitative modelling anyway they now accept that doing it properly will take months rather than weeks and ill have a freer hand in my choice of modelling tool so a chat with tom would be extremely valuablecheerssteve enron capital trade resources corp from grant masson pm to steven leppardlonectectcc subject real options presentationstevei read through your presentation looks good as expected remind me is this an internal enron or external presentation if external i would say it is just at the limit before sliding into proprietary stuff perhaps thats why youve neatly almost entirely avoided questions about discounting and riskneutrality or lack of itregardsgrant

of our projects are set up to help businesses that face massive uncertainties of some kind decision analysis helps people explore problems and redesign their decisionmaking process to increase the chance of them making the right choices for example imagine a biotechnology company that has to decide whether to put itself up for sale enter a strategic relationship or continue to go it alone each of those options will lead on to other valueenhancing or valuedestroying scenarios we work with the client firstly to understand and challenge the assumptions associated with their most likely business development scenarios and secondly to help them identify decisions that would help protect or increase the value of their technology or company quantifying technical regulatory or commercial risks can sometimes be a challenge in technologyintensive fields however we have found that managers often scientists are quite willing to describe the main sources of risk and to assess the probability that a risky event may or may not occur how does this kind of risky decisionmaking relate to real options valuation you cant say what the value of an asset is until you decide what you might use it for this means that to form an opinion about the value of an asset you must explore the most important decisions that you are likely to face and that will have a significant impact on the value of the asset so decision analysis helps to define the business problem and to uncover a stream of interrelated choices that are in effect real options for example if a company is trying to decide whether to invest in a risky project does it have the option to pull the plug on the investment at an early stage if a pilot project gives a poor showing that real option reduces the riskiness and increases the potential value of the original business plan so real options and decision analysis are really very close to one another but you dont have to believe in real options valuations to find decision analysis useful what do you mean often decision analysis can help managers to identify the key risks in a strategic decision attach weights to these and show clearly how they interact for many companies this risk discovery is the most valuable part of the exercise real options theory has been criticised recently for being well not very realistic is it a practical approach to valuation its important not to hold out unrealistic hopes for the real options approach to valuation but its an exciting methodology and its also sometimes the only reasonable way of tackling a very practical problem for example when a firm sells an asset the firm might have to make an independent valuation of the asset for legal or corporate governance reasons but in many businesses today there are assets that simply cannot be valued in traditional ways because they are difficult to link to cashflows the cashflows might not exist because the business is so novel or they might be hidden in some respects a real options analysis is much closer to reality than a traditional valuation how exactly the classic way of valuing a future business is to base the calculation on a single discounted cashflow that is projected from the activity but this doesnt really take account of the way that scenarios can change or the fact that managers can react to situations as they unfold i mentioned earlier the option to kill a project or business at an early point but the upside is that if a pilot project yields exciting results it might allow you to invest more quickly and reach a revenuegenerating position in a much shorter time than the original business plan allows so to value a future business we really need to look at the cashflows that might arise in a number of scenarios this is realistic in that if the project gets the green light you can bet that its managers will be taking that kind of decision on the ground all of the time whats the most challenging part of mapping out a decision analysis tree modelling the links between the variables in the decision tree its something we have particular strengths in but its also tricky to know when its worthwhile to add on more detail and when its better to draw back in a recent erisk interview rick buy chief risk officer of enron said that over the two years that enron had experimented with the real options concept it had found it of limited but not zero use why is there a slight air of cynicism about real options in some businesses today its strange that enron would profess this attitude a few years ago it was widely reported to have used real option valuation to support a very profitable purchase decision they had apparently bought cheaply some older generators in the us that generated electricity at a very high cost they knew that they could mothball them for most of the year and switch them on only when the electricity prices were sufficiently high nevertheless from a customers point of view there might have been too much hype about the methodology one problem in the application of real options technology is that there are perhaps too many people trying to tweak reality to conform to their perfect model its better to aim for something pragmatic that clearly improves decisions over time in one pharmaceutical company we worked with recently we worked together to improve their valuation analyses by moving from a single discounted cashflow methodology to one that took into account a rather small set of business scenarios it would have shocked some academics and consultants but it was an undeniable improvement on the original approach why do you think financial institutions are only just picking up on your field when its been applied in the energy industry for years or more it might have something to do with the relative stability of the banking world until recently and the relatively high margins that banking lines have enjoyed also industries such as energy and pharmaceuticals tend to have more people with an engineering and science background the dynamic modelling of decisions is based on methodologies originally dreamed up to help engineers design electrical and electronic systems this approach is quite distinct from the blackscholes options analyses that the banking world is familiar with the blackscholes approach is difficult to apply in a real options context because everything depends on the assumptions that you put into the blackscholes model the real options approach on the other hand is in a sense a way of modelling those assumptions more explicitly but banks are now adopting some of the thinking particularly in terms of using decision analysis to pinpoint risks and identify valueenhancing decisions and in using real options methodologies to sort the wheat from the chaff in their more speculative investments you mean their internet investments we have recently worked with a major dutch bank that had arrived late in the internet game and then made a considerable number of investments now that even bb business models have questions marks hanging over them and many bc businesses are already under water they wanted to work out which investments might contain real value in this situation its a case of ranking priorities and helping the bank make sense of what could turn into a decisionmaking chaos rather than sophisticated valuation its not just a case of whether an internet investment should be killed off but the problem of whether continued funding for it should take priority over budget demands for major it upgrades in existing businesses and so on these are very practical questions and they have to be answered somehow are there other areas in financial institutions that seem accessible to this approach yes for example we think it can help work out the value associated with various approaches to marketing a new bank business line at the moment many banks are chasing highnetworth individuals but its not always clear which kind of individual a particular bank should decide to pursue the bank might have a regional or industry advantage already in one particular area for example music business people but what is the churn rate associated with this kind of customer what is the profitability associated with the customer segment will the time and cost benefits of the advantages the bank has in the sector outweigh any disadvantages weighing up this kind of complex problem where one thing leads to and depends on another is what decision and real options analysis is good at is there any way of rigorously backtesting or validating real options valuations in all honesty not really the problem is that by the time the option is exercised many of the variables surrounding it will have changed so its difficult to compare our original analysis with how things turn out however the value of the analysis comes not only from the final number the value of this asset is x but also from providing a thorough process an outsiders point of view an understanding of the sources of value and in short a bit of clearer thinking if real options are so important why are they so rarely cited in communications to shareholders and equity analysts the battle is still to convince companies to use real option valuations as a significant part of their internal analysis even in major companies in the oil gas and pharmaceutical sectors where the ideas have taken some root internally there seems to be a lot of reluctance to use them in external communication we are working with analysts to understand better what they need to if we are to move things on to the next step how does the riskiness of a business in terms of the major strategic dilemmas it faces relate to its share value and its capital structure thats a big question its related to work my colleagues do on the optimal debttoequity capital structure and gearing of a corporation which in turn arises out of the likely revenue and cost volatilities of the business the more volatile the business the less gearing it can sustain and the higher the cost of capital our work touches on this in the sense that exercising many specific real options can allow a firm to change its nature and thus also its risk profile one classic example is the pharmaceutical industry a host of different kinds of companies service that industry from big pharma companies through to smaller biotechnology startups and runofthemill contract research organisations a contract research organisation is often operating within a very competitive environment with relatively few risksit does not invest in drug development itself but also very thin margins but in fact a few of these companies have used the skills and knowledge they have developed to become much more substantial and profitable healthcare companies of various kinds its an example of a company exercising the real options that lie within its skills and assets to transform its own identity rob jameson erisk

well after plowing through their page manual and sitting through todays hour moodys presentation it is necessary for us to have information about enrons counterparties to move to the next step with riskcalc we have obtained some information on enrons european counterparties from our colleagues in the london office we need for you andor your colleagues in the houston office to supply us with a list of enrons north american counterparties more specifically to evaluate moodys riskcalc we will need the following financial inputs for enrons north american private firm counterparties fiscal yearthe prior twelve months of financial data are represented annual statements are usable as well as quarterly statements after summing the flow variables such as cost of goods sold net income sales and ebit the value should be a fourdigit integer year without mention of the day or month such as or forecasts until the year can be made a constant rate of inflation is applied to future years using last years inflation level in general this estimation error will not cause any great problems as size affects default rates at very large scales eg vs makes a significant difference vs does not cash equivalentsthis measure of liquid assets includes cash and marketable securities inventoryinventories are taken directly from the balance sheet in thousands dollars without any alterations for accounting method eg lifo fifo average cost this item represents merchandise bought for resale and materials and supplies purchased for use in production of revenue specifically this would include purchase cost sales cost sales taxes transportation costs insurance costs and storage costscurrent assetsthis item primarily represents cash inventories accounts receivables marketable securities and other current assets total assetstotal assets and every other variable are entered in thousands of dollars for example should be entered as specifically total assets are the sum of current assets plus net property plant and equipment plus other noncurrent assets including intangible assets deferred items and investments and advances leave previous years total assets blank for australian companies current liabilitiesliabilities are positive values included in current liabilities are shortterm debt accounts payable and other current liabilities total liabilitiesthis balance sheet account total liabilities is a positive number representing the sum of current liabilities plus longterm debt plus other noncurrent liabilities including deferred taxes investment tax credit and minority interest retained earningsretained earnings a historical measure of performance is the cumulative earnings of the company less total dividend distributions to shareholders typically it is the prior years retained earnings plus net income less distributions retained earnings are generally positive some firms with low credit quality will have negative retained earnings leave this field blank for australian companies salesthis item consists of the industry segments gross sales the amount of actual billings to customers for regular sales completed during the period reduced by cash discounts trade discounts and returned sales and allowances for which credit is given to customers cost of goods soldentered in thousands of dollars this value is generally a positive number less than sales it represents all costs directly allocated by the company to production such as material labor and overhead not fixed overhead or items that would be included in selling general and administrative expenses leave this field blank for australian companies ebitearning before interest expense is operating income after depreciation it can be positive or negative but is usually greater then net income interest expensethis item represents the periodic expense to the company of securing short and longterm debt typically we expect this charge to be approximately the prevailing interest rate times the total liabilities one measure of computing this is interest expense total liabilities net incomethis item represents the income or loss reported by a company after expenses and losses have been subtracted from all revenues and gains for the fiscal period including extraordinary items and discontinued operations a loss is represented by a negative sign for example a loss would be entered as leave previous years net income blank for australian companies extraordinary itemspositive or negative this item represents unusual items that sometimes appear on the income statement the items are designated by the company as extraordinary and presented after net income from continuing operations and discontinued operations these items include extraordinary gainslosses income loss from discontinued operations and cumulative affect of accounting changes expenses are entered as negative values gains as positive values leave previous years extraordinary items blank for australian companies countrythis model is calibrated for the united states canada and australia we look forward to receiving this information for enrons private firm north american counterparties so that we can

well after plowing through their page manual and sitting through todays hour moodys presentation it is necessary for us to have information about enrons counterparties to move to the next step with riskcalc we have obtained some information on enrons european counterparties from our colleagues in the london office we need for you andor your colleagues in the houston office to supply us with a list of enrons north american counterparties more specifically to evaluate moodys riskcalc we will need the following financial inputs for enrons north american private firm counterparties fiscal yearthe prior twelve months of financial data are represented annual statements are usable as well as quarterly statements after summing the flow variables such as cost of goods sold net income sales and ebit the value should be a fourdigit integer year without mention of the day or month such as or forecasts until the year can be made a constant rate of inflation is applied to future years using last years inflation level in general this estimation error will not cause any great problems as size affects default rates at very large scales eg vs makes a significant difference vs does not cash equivalentsthis measure of liquid assets includes cash and marketable securities inventoryinventories are taken directly from the balance sheet in thousands dollars without any alterations for accounting method eg lifo fifo average cost this item represents merchandise bought for resale and materials and supplies purchased for use in production of revenue specifically this would include purchase cost sales cost sales taxes transportation costs insurance costs and storage costscurrent assetsthis item primarily represents cash inventories accounts receivables marketable securities and other current assets total assetstotal assets and every other variable are entered in thousands of dollars for example should be entered as specifically total assets are the sum of current assets plus net property plant and equipment plus other noncurrent assets including intangible assets deferred items and investments and advances leave previous years total assets blank for australian companies current liabilitiesliabilities are positive values included in current liabilities are shortterm debt accounts payable and other current liabilities total liabilitiesthis balance sheet account total liabilities is a positive number representing the sum of current liabilities plus longterm debt plus other noncurrent liabilities including deferred taxes investment tax credit and minority interest retained earningsretained earnings a historical measure of performance is the cumulative earnings of the company less total dividend distributions to shareholders typically it is the prior years retained earnings plus net income less distributions retained earnings are generally positive some firms with low credit quality will have negative retained earnings leave this field blank for australian companies salesthis item consists of the industry segments gross sales the amount of actual billings to customers for regular sales completed during the period reduced by cash discounts trade discounts and returned sales and allowances for which credit is given to customers cost of goods soldentered in thousands of dollars this value is generally a positive number less than sales it represents all costs directly allocated by the company to production such as material labor and overhead not fixed overhead or items that would be included in selling general and administrative expenses leave this field blank for australian companies ebitearning before interest expense is operating income after depreciation it can be positive or negative but is usually greater then net income interest expensethis item represents the periodic expense to the company of securing short and longterm debt typically we expect this charge to be approximately the prevailing interest rate times the total liabilities one measure of computing this is interest expense total liabilities net incomethis item represents the income or loss reported by a company after expenses and losses have been subtracted from all revenues and gains for the fiscal period including extraordinary items and discontinued operations a loss is represented by a negative sign for example a loss would be entered as leave previous years net income blank for australian companies extraordinary itemspositive or negative this item represents unusual items that sometimes appear on the income statement the items are designated by the company as extraordinary and presented after net income from continuing operations and discontinued operations these items include extraordinary gainslosses income loss from discontinued operations and cumulative affect of accounting changes expenses are entered as negative values gains as positive values leave previous years extraordinary items blank for australian

michellewenzenroncom gayle muenchenronenronxgate jeremy blachmanhoueesees cc subject credit risk model comments at this point hi everyone i have run the model and along with the contract briefs i have some questions ideas i was hoping to talk to each of you so i could avoid writing this detailed onesided email but with our schedules being so exclusive this will have to do for now every deal has its own model because of the commodity deal structure complexity so no aggregate results can be obtained without having the mode ls for each contract however the jc pennys version can serve as a testin g platform for some of the items i am mentioning below i have not talked to the people in research who are the most knowledgeable about the model so some of these comments may be mute points i plan to do that went i get bac k since the credit risk is developed for a time period it makes sense to regularly update the commodity data and credit rating if its chaged and rerun the model for the time remaining i would expect this is done alrea dy the default probabilities seem not to change that is if the input cred it rating is e then the e default probability curve is used for the contrac t period for annual accounting that seems ok but in mtm it seems to me tha t the credit analysis needs to take into consideration the credit rating transition probabilities that is the credit implications of companies changing their credit rating during the contract period with some constraints imposed by actually slow credits appear to change would give a more realistic view of our credit risk in the mtm world are all defaults created equal to us look at oc it seems to me that the data used to develop the default probabilities are over different business segments and are ok for that range of companies however we a re dealing with specific types of firms where default may not mean we do not get paid sure we still have some credit risk but its not like montgom ery wards where the lights are being turned off for good energy is so fundamental for a companys success and default actions can be used as a way to save a company albeit in a different form so financial default does no t neccesarily mean default for ees commodity payments totally a while back someone said to me that may maybe the people who reach for a life preserver are more likely to live than those that dont by that i mean that perhaps our use of these default probabilities actually overstates th e credit risk in that if a company has at least enough proactive vision to contract ees then they are more likely to improve that one that doesnt this is a type of behavioral variable that the data doesnt consider th is would be a useful mba project to examine these types of corporate variables and compare it to their credit rating forward curve this leads me to something i hope we can acomplish in the special financ e team the contract briefs are to me the begimnning of this exercise if we can combine our customers into exposure group portfolios for lack of a better term where a group has similar risk characteristics beyind the current parameter set that we define then this offers a potential to shop some of these exposure to specialized insurance markets a technical point monte carlo simulations are numerical experiments besides the model assumptions numerical experiments have three inherent error attributes the number of trials numerical roundoff and random numb er generator randomness statistical properties the first two are not a proble m in this application but the last one could be

credit ::::::>>>>>> re pricing credit on thousands of names we can continue the discussion in tuesdays conference call but i discussed with ben about the issues below and here are some thoughts this is not a complete approach but only a starting point for discussionthe main task is to build a pricing system for many namesthis has two components how to price a single name how to price a liquid single name how to price an illiquid single name how to efficiently apply the methodology to multiple namesthe approach i would take for is a define a small set of liquid namesb apply each of the different models we have say the six models ben has mentioned below to these namesc include market prices if any for these namesd sit with traders get traders intuition on where each liquid name should price and note this on the spectrum of prices obtained in b and ce try to determine attributes of the names that may explain the dispersion of the trader prices across the modelsf quantify these attributes if possibleg try a different set of liquid names and repeat the process and see if the decisions in the last round still make sensethe approach for may bea define a small set of illiquid namesb apply each of the different models we have to these namesc sit with traders get traders intuition on where each illiquid name should price and note this on the spectrum of prices obtained in bd try to determine attributes of the names that may explain the dispersion of the trader prices across the modelse check if these are similar to the attributes identified for liquid namesf define a master set of liquid namesg look for relationships by analyzing crosssection of data between attributes or prices of illiquid names to those of liquid names once a mapping has been defined for an illiquid name to a set of liquid names and their attributes then this mapping can be entered into a table and the pricing can be automated for all names in theory the success will depend on the success of the roundtable sessions for the approaches for and building a new fundamental model is always a worthwhile task but we can get going with the above approaches immediately in parallel with developing any new models that we may build new models can be added to the suite of existing models i do not believe there will ever be a single model that will answer all questions for all names but rather we can refine the mappings and relative choices among models over time which would mean continuing roundtable sessions with traders limited data makes calibration very hard so i would continually ask the question what do we calibrate throughout the discussions for and and this may help guide us to new modelsvasantbenjamin parsons amto ect london credit tradingcc vince j

oliver gaylardlonectect subject pricing credit on thousands of namesall our challenge for the next few months is to build an automated system to provide differential pricing on thousands of credits by yearend most of these credits will be illiquid in terms of market price information making the challenge harder and the end result more important in terms of competitive pricing advantage what we need is an overall strategy for how we plan to achieve this from the quantitative perspectivecurrently we have several models for credit pricing either in use or under developmentfmc model default probability approach using bloombergs fair market par yield curves probabilities are generated from the riskylibor then defaultbankruptcy swap prices computed using expectation methodologyfmc model credit spread approach using the fmcs then directly taking the libor credit spread at each tenor adjusting for basis and compounding differencesbond model fmc approach taking the fmcs as benchmark curves the model regresses the input bonds specific to a name on the two best fitting benchmarks the result is a zero yield curve with the same shape as the fmcs but with the level tweaked for the specific issuer prices are then generated using both spread and probability approaches under testingbond model spline approach taking only the bonds specific to an issuer the model fits an exponential cubic spline to the zerocoupon price curve then builds a zero yield curve from this under testingmarket prices for certain liquid names or sectorsratings cds market prices are used then recovery and event discount used to get bankruptcy swap priceskmv using expected default frequencies edfs from the kmv model and database we will build a model to price default swaps making appropriate risk adjustments kmv is being installed now so model will be worked on nexteach of these models returns a price credit default and bankruptcy and the accuracy of the price depends on many factors liquidity and regulatory differences between bond and cds markets recovery assumptions risk premia capital charges etc the aim will be to accurately price as many liquid names as possible based upon these models then use these prices alongside other financial information as the backbone to a full automated pricing system our inputs to the proposed pricing system for a specific name are model and market prices for all issuers alongside namespecific soft data from credit reports and financial statements if the credit is liquid enough a price will be generated from their own information only otherwise the credit will be mapped onto a subset of liquid credits with financial information and historical price movements providing the mapping and weights the model price will then be periodically adjusted to align itself with market or trader prices and this adjustment will feed back into the weighting and mapping composition in loose terms we could think of the system price for an illiquid credit as being a weighted average of liquid market prices bonds equities default swaps where the weightings are calibrated using credit analysis financial ratios etcthe key steps to implementing such a system will beestablishing what exactly we want to predict is it a price a rating a probability or a score we will need a clean market history to calibrate to which we only really have for ratings we will then need to develop a mapping from ratingscore to pricegetting and cleaning the historical financial and credit data required to calibrate the modelbuilding the mechanics of the model ie the calibration methodology neural netsfuzzy logic seem the obvious candidates but which exact methods and software packages to usedetermining an automated methodology for mapping names with limited information into the modelgetting the true market price in order to feed back an error at present such a price exists for very few creditsallocating resources to the development mckinsey claimed such a system would take manmonths to developfurther ideas or comments are requested as we need to develop our strategy asap the model description above is fairly vague as we dont yet have the knowledge needed to fill in the specific details further help will be especially required on this if we are to continue to move at internet speedregardsben

ha d indicated that the discussions with the panel would take place on may according to sources enron would be meeting the panel with representatives of its lenders and shareholders the godbole committee that studied the current power purchase agreement has called for cancellation of the presen t tariff structure renegotiation of the lng and shipping contract removal o f dollar denomination as far as fixed charges of the tariff is concerned deb t restructuring and the formation of a committee to renegotiate the power purchase agreement these suggestions it seems may not be acceptable to enron the maharashtra government accepted the report and asked the godbole committee to renegotiate the committee has been given a months time to renegotiate on behalf of the state government with dpc for a new ppa the committee has opined that since the lng facility of mmpta is far in excess of what is required by the plant only mmpta of which mmpta is on take or pay it should be separated into a distinct facility whose capital costs should not be reflected in the fuel charge not as take or pa y it should instead be only in proportion to the fuel regassified for the pow er generation using the entire allocated gas requires an unusually high plf instead the surplus gas can be sold to other players like petronet or enro n s own metgas it is important to distribute the cost over the entire capacity and not just the amount sold to the power plant says the committee similarly it has been suggested that enron could lease out the harbour facilities as a common facility to other lng importers on the lng contract negotiated by enron for longterm supplies it has said that since the lng market has witnessed great changes particularly as far as prices a re concerned the power company should take advantage of spot buys and renegotiate the contract accordingly the times of india friday may enron ready to take part in ppa talk nitin yeshwantrao the enron management has finally agreed

its india md k wade cline to serve a termination notice to mseb the state government on its part too adopted a confrontational position by slapping a rs crore rebate charge on dpc fo r defaulting on power supplyhowever the sudden change of heart by the enron management is largely attributed to the stand taken by its local lenders le d by industrial development bank of india idbi which had recently opposed t he move to pull out of the project this was in contradiction to the stand tak en by the foreign lenders of the dpc who were in favour of slamming the brakes on disbursement of funds to dpc the congressled democratic front governme nt had publicly declared that it would impress upon the enron management to renegotiate the ppa as scrapping the project would not be in the interest o

termination notice hanging on its head maharashtra state electricity board on thursday made a protest payment of rs crore disputed amount towards march bill of rs crore to dabhol we were ready with

up at the disputes resolution forum of which enron india managing director k wade cline and krishna rao are members mseb sources said last week dpc had dashed off a communication to the government and mseb th at it would not accept protest payments anymore cline had said the energy major shall treat such payments as an election to pay the sums which mseb in fact owed dpc in full and that the company would also not recognise the purported protest or reservation mseb had paid a rs crore february bill in protest last month on april last both domestic and internation al lenders of dpc had met

agreement to the maharashtra state electricity board and the state government the board has authori sed wade cline to serve the termination notice however this does not mean tha t the termination notice will be served immediately it is only an enabling provision and will be used only if the situation arises a state govern ment source told business standard from london he said dpc was under pressure from its lenders the dpc spokesperson here refused to comment on the issue the hardening of the boards stand is in sharp contrast to the advice of dpcs lenders w ho had warned enron not to precipitate matters by issuing a termination notice the lenders had arrived at a consensus that the termination notice need not be served at this stage serving of the notice requires a nod from the lenders who have an exposure of about billion in the project sources said given the lenders strong opposition to termination of the contract t he enron boards enabling resolution did not have much significance beyond conveying a hardening of its stand with regard to the current imbroglio th e maharashtra chief minister had warned enron not to scuttle the process of crisis resolution by issuing a termination notice the state government is to nominate an expert group to renegotiate the terms of the dabhol contract enron holds per cent in dpc while usbased ge and bechtel hold per cent each the balance per cent is held by mseb through a special purpos e vehicle maharashtra power development corporation the mseb representative s were not allowed to vote at the meeting since they were an interested party the idbi representative protested against the boards decision the meeting was attended by state energy secretary vm lal the meeting was held against the backdrop of a dispute between mseb and dpc over payment of bills after mseb failed to pay rs crore towards the december bill dpc invoked the state governments guarantee and then the union governments counter guarantee when payment of the rs crore january bill became overdue dpc again invoked the state governments guarantee mseb retaliate d on january by slapping a rs crore penalty for nonsupply of electricity at adequate levels it demanded that dpc adjust the bills again st this penalty this stand of mseb was explained to dpc at the board meeting a state government official said the centre also supported msebs stand an d refused to honour the counter guarantee the power company then invoked the political force majeure clause a process of conciliation and arbitration between the centre and dpc is currently on the financial express friday april foreign lenders slam brakes on disbursements to dpc sanjay jog raghu mo han global banks comfortable with enron pullout lenders to the dabhol power company dpc are a sharply divided lot international lenders in direct contrast to the stand taken by local ones led by the the industrial develoment bank of india idbi are categorical that additional assistance to dpcs phaseii will be held in abeyance de spite the completion of per cent of the project workthe stage is also set for a preliminary termination notice to be served by dpc to the maharashtra state electricity board mseb within the next four weeksthis follows the authorisation given to enron indias managing director k wade cline and dpc president ceo neil mcgregor to serve the termination notice and transfer notices to mseb following wednesdays dpc board meeting in london the essence of the message from the international lenders following the london meeting with dpc board is emotions do not work contractual obligations and payments have to be met we are convinced that the mseb has failed to meet its obligations there is no point in enron continuing with the project and the company should get out of itthe structuring of dpc s debt has created two classes of lenders in phasei international lenders are covered by a sovereign guarantee while in phaseii no lender is however all lenders have a parri passu charge making attachment of assets a messy affair sources in international banks were quick to point out that local lenders t o phaseii of the project are worried that an awry dpc project will affect their interests more given that they have no security other than asset s like a sovereign cover it was this desperation that made local lenders like idbi slash the interest rates a few months back to per cent from per cent a leading foreign banker pointed outthree points that were m ade clear and stressed in no uncertain terms by international lenders were a there are contractual obligations b mseb was not punctual in its payments to dpc and c mseb adopted a confrontational position by slapping a rs cro re rebate charge on dpc for misdeclaration and default on the availability of power while local lenders led by idbi with mseb parroting the same were of the view that the current situation is a temporary one international lenders were steadfast that pulling out of the project is the only way out this is despite the stance taken by idbi and mseb that authorisation for terminatio n given to mr cline and mr mcgregor was not called for international bankers pointed out that they will now have to look at the issue of charges and protection for their loans in the event of the power project being scrapped in its present formthe points of contention are a that phasei of dpc is backed by a sovereign guarantee b phaseii is not and c to the extent tha t phaseii is covered by assets cancellation of phaseii may see all assets even those under phasei getting attached therefore an examination o n the segregation of assets under phasei and phaseii is now warranted pti adds in a significant move dpc board has empowered its management to sever power supply

described the decisi on as a procedural move consistent with dpcs negotiating s trategy to recover overdue payments from the mseb after the company issues the preliminary termination notice step two

vinay bansal and technical director prem paunikar both directors on the dpc board and the state principal secretary energy vm lal an invitee to the board raised the issue at the board meeting in london mseb claimed that dpc was needlessly threatening to issue various arbitration notices and thereby interpreting the clauses of ppa in isolationin recent weeks dabhol has raised the stakes in its spat with th e mseb delivering a notice of political force majeure to maharashtra a step typically invoked to dissolve a contract in case of an emergency like a war coup or a similar radical political event in this case dpcs move was viewed as a threat to stop providing electricitydpc has come under fire because of the relatively high cost of its power critics object to the company charging rs a kilowatthour for its power compared with around rs a kilowatthour charged by other suppliers the hindu friday april offer of renegotiation too late enron by mahesh vijapurkar mumbai april the enronsponsored dabhol power company which last nigh t authorised its local management to issue a notice of termination of its pow er purchase agreement ppa with the maharashtra state electricity board has decided to keep a stiff upper lip this in turn has stoked speculation th at the switching off of power from its phase i plant was imminent while in reality a lengthy procedure has to be followed as prescribed within the pp a as one source familiar with the ppa told the hindu ``it is not sudden deat h of the project and in all probability the dpc vexed with the developments including sharp and pointed observations by the godbole committee has chosen to only arm itself with a serious option ``this woul d only eventually come into effect it is not an overnight operation and a lo t of legal work is involved apparently the dpc intends to do some armtwisting at the board of directors meeting in london which maharashtra was initiall y disinclined to attend but later used the forum to put across its contention s on the project the dpc squarely told the mseb nominees on the board that t he offer of renegotiation had come rather ``too late it also said it did no t see any room for optimism about the outcome it did not however rule out the option of talks thus underscoring the possibility that the decision to authorise termination was a new weapon the maharashtra chief minister mr vilasrao deshmukh had hoped that dpc would not take any ``harsh step which would cause lot of damage to the interests of both the independent power producer and the government and tod ay he expressed his dismay in fact the mandate of the team that went on the strength of its stake in the dpc was to put across the idea that negotiati on was the requirement and not confrontation echo in ls the enron issue also echoed in the lok sabha today where the power minister mr suresh prabhu said that scrapping of the agreement would cost the cent re rs crores whose liability in the project agreement was limited the centres liability in case of termination is one years electricity bill an d a termination fee of million blow to fis the termination could prove to be a serious blow to the indian financial institutions fis which under the leadership of the idbi were trying to convince the other lenders of the project against the notice the exposure of indian fis in the project is

wednesday in london authorise d the company management to issue a termination notice to the maharashtra sta te electricity board the company however may not pull out of the project ye t considering its lenders who met on monday opposed such a move and favoure d renegotiations sources present during both the meetings said that though foreign lenders supported enron on the termination issue domestic financia l institutions led by the industrial development bank of india prevailed ov er the deliberations to oppose any such drastic move enron needs the lenders consent to file a pretermination notice for pulling out from the project the decision to empower dpc chief wade cline to issue a termination notice was taken with six votes in favour against a single idbi vote against such a move another significant development during the entire proceedings was that the financial institutions made it clear that further funding of phase ii of th e project will depend on the government of india assuring payment mechanisms institutions are yet to disburse about per cent of the sanctioned packag e which is crucial for completing the phase ii expansion project ``the board has given powers to wade cline to issue a pretermination notice but the meeting quite unanimously felt the need of the hour is not to terminate the project but to initiate serious renegotiation proceedings said mseb chairman vinay bansal who attended the board meeting ``mseb presented the ir views to the board members and it was understood by enron which also includ ed the rs crore penalty issue which is heading for arbitration proceedings ``we have also made it clear that the tariff structure of enron is quite hi gh and a downward revision of tariffs is unavoidable bansal added ``they cannot issue a termination notice without our consent since our exposure in the project is quite large and the lenders should approve any plans in that direction said a top banker who was present during the lenders meet ``there is a general consensus that the project must be completed and the proposal to terminate the ppa should be kept in abeyance he added the global arrangers for the dpc include anz investment bank credit suisse first boston abnamro citibank and the state bank of india where all these parties conducted separate meetings with the company officials however some bankers said the company can file a termination notice even if one lender with a minimum per cent exposure on the project favours such proceedings meanwhile in a clear reversal of roles maharashtra chief minister vilasra o deshmukh said that the state government was not keen on terminating the ppa ``we will ask them to refrain from taking any such harsh steps since that would be bad news for all of us including dpc deshmukh said deshmukh w as echoing union power minister suresh prabhus sentiments who said that the government wanted an amicable settlement of the payment row he however added that termination of the project would not hurt foreign investments a nd dismissed warnings by analysts that winding up the billion project wou ld be a blow to indias efforts to woo foreign investors the dpc has already slapped one conciliation notice on the centre and three arbitration notices on the state government over nonpayment of dues amounting to rs crore and interest towards the bills due for december and january meanwhile mseb officials said in mumbai that the march bills amounting to rs crore was paid on thursday as protest payment despite the dispute over the amount when asked on the

has authorised the managing director mr neil mcgregor to issue the notice of intent to terminate its power purchase agreement ppa with the maharashtra state electricity board mseb ``at an appropriate time the decision was taken at a board meeting held in london yesterday ``while mseb which is an `interested party was not allowed to vote it made a presentation clarifying its stand on the matter a senior state government official said the resolution to authorise the management to issue the termination notice was carried by six votes to one idbi voted against the decision the official said the serving of the preliminary termination notice will lead to a sixmonth ``suspension period according to clause of the termination procedure of the ppa ``following the giving of a preliminary termination notice the parties shall consult for a period of six months o r such longer period as they may agree as to what step shall be taken with a view to mitigating the consequences of the relevant event having regard to all the circumstances idbi and state bank of india the principal indian lenders had earlier persuaded the overseas lenders to hold their consent to the termination notice for some more time at least one lender has to consent for the compa ny to serve termination notice it is understood that overseas lenders are in favour of termination of the project and are prepared to consent however domestic lenders are worried about the security of their advances if the pp a is abandoned midway according to institutional sources indian lenders are trying to get all th e parties concerned to thrash out outstanding issues the maharashtra and central governments too are in favour of a conciliation mr vilasrao deshmukh chief minister of maharashtra yesterday went on record that the state did not want the project terminated mr yashwant sinha union finance minister is also understood to be of the same opinion ``the dpc will now have to decide what is the `appropriate time to serve the notice the official said mseb pays rs crore meanwhile mseb has paid dpc rs crore towards its march bill mseb officials confirmed that the bill w as paid `in protest

t n raghunatha dabhol power company dpc has begun to put fresh pressure on the maharasht ra state electricity board mseb the maharashtra state government and the centre for an early resolution to the prolonged dispute between them if th e dpc board of directors decision to authorise its managing director to serv e a contract termination notice to the mseb is any indication the dpc board in its meeting in london on wednesday empowered the company management to sever its power supply agreement with mseb a move that could inflict a financial liability of rs crore on the centre the decision to authorise the dpc management to issue a termination notice to mseb was taken by a vote of six to one after the maharasthra government representatives were prevented from voting on the ground of interested party when contacted the companys mumbaibased spokesperson mr jimmy mogal declined to comment on the reports about the decision taken by the dpc boar d we have nothing to say on the reports emanating from london we will expre ss our views after a few days he said however maharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh on thursday termed the dpc boards decision as unfortunate we have already requested the company not to take any harsh decision mr deshmukh said in mumbai official sources in the state energy ministry interpreted the dpc boards decision as a pressure tactic employed by the enron subsidiary to force the mseb to clear the pending power bills without any further delay through it s tough posture the dpc wants to make its position stronger before it can formally agree for renegotiations with the mseb the centre and the state government for cutting the price of power supplied by it to the state electricity board the sources said that the dpcs reported decision to authorise its managing director to stop electricity supply to the mseb did not mean that the enron subsidiary would actually go ahead with the scrappi ng of the power contract with the mseb if anything the dpcs reported decision is to mount additional pressure o n the mseb for clearance of pending power bills and put itself in a stronger position in settling its dispute with the mseb as part of its plan to arm itself with powers to break a contract in case situation goes beyond its control the dpc had recently served a political force majeure to the mseb the centre and the state government the sources saidnot surprisingly th e dpcs london decision comes on the heels of the maharashtra governments decision to set up a highlevel committee comprising representatives of th e mseb the centre and the state government to renegotiate with the enrons subsidiary company for reducing the cost of power supplied to the state electricity boardmeanwhile amidst the threat of a possible

saying there would not be any adverse effect on foreign investment in power if enron walks out we do not see fdi inflo ws into the power sector being hit power minister suresh prabhu saidmseb officials said the ball is now in the court of dpc which said its corporat e policy did not allow it to comment on proceedings at board meetings the decision coincided with a rs crore protest payment by the cash strapped power board as part of the march bill worth rs crore there was speculation that mseb coughed up the amount to cool frayed temper s at enrons hub in houston and because it was rattled by the sudden turn of events in the past few days during which the dispute had come to a head ms eb officials brushed away the allusions saying the cheque was ready on wednesday but could not

according to reports quoting the chairman of the maharashtra stat e electricity board mr vinay bansal while dpc officials refuse to comment on anything it is learnt that mseb w as itself prepared to serve a legal notice of termination just two days before the meetingmseb was said to have been dissuaded by the nationalist congres s party president mr sharad pawar and union power minister mr suresh

cent re is ready to go for conciliation with the dpc for failing to honour its counterguaranteefurther the dpc has already slapped a notice of politica l force majeure which protects itself against undeserved claims in the event of exigencies that force it to take an extreme stepthe union power minister mr suresh prabhu contended in delhi that since dpc contributed only per cent of the total energy output of the country its termination would not have such a phenomenal impact on the power situation however if terminations proceedings go through enron corp a per cent shareholder in the dabhol power company would stand to net a hefty amount in damages the union power secretary has been quoted as saying that termination of the dpc would cost the centre rs crore which is the total of one years electricity bill and a termination fee of milli on according to an energy analyst mr pradyumna kaul the total liability woul d not cross rs crore however mr prabhu said in the lok sabha

presentthe notice was prepared over the past weeke nd and taken by the delegation when they called on mr prabhu on april however the politicians convinced them that enron would not get tough giv en its huge stake in the project and that such a notice would not be necessar y the meeting thus ended with the decision to renegotiate the power tariff with enrons consent among those present at the london meeting were mr lal mr bansal and mseb technical director mr p paunikar in their capacity as directors however they abstained from voting since they were deemed an interested party the only vote to go against the decision was that of the idbi which is also represented on the board it is learntthe chief minister mr vilasrao deshmukh said the state was not in favour of terminating the project this could mean that the latest manoeuvre to armtwist the indian authorities could achieve its immediate target of getting the arrears accumulated over the past three months clearedthe mseb owes enron rs crore for march and rs crore for december and january the centre today p ut up a brave face on enrons decision saying there would not be any advers e effect on foreign investment in

him about t he meeting in london with regard to the states failure to pay enron ranganathan said bills are prepared as per the power purchase agreement ppa and dpc owes some money to us our people informed enron officials about this in fact ther e was no reason to give powers to the md to slap a termination noticein the london meeting mseb and industrial development bank of india idbi

decisio n to renegotiate the contract an enron spokesman declined to divulge what transpired at the meeting sayi ng the issues discussed at the meeting were confidential we have not received any direct communication unless we get it and evaluate the detail s we have no comments to make the spokesman said when asked about the proposed decision on renegotiation of the project in which the maharashtra state electricity board mseb has per cent stake asked whether the board had taken a decision on empowering dpc managing director neil mcgregor to wind up its operations in india the

this evening chief minister vilasrao deshmukh said today addressing media persons after his meeting with the noted socia l reformer anna hazare at his official residence varsha deshmukh said the committee would be formed by this evening or by tomorrow at the mosthe termed as unfortunate the enron board decision empowering dpc chief neil mcgregor to serve a preliminary termination notice on the maharashtra state electricity board and said the state was willing to negotiate the issue wit h power company renegotiations will be held as per the suggestions made by the godbole committee and the center will also depute its representative on the renegotiating committee we dont want to take any hasty decision deshmuk h saidhe pointed that the only bone of contention with the dpc had been its expensive tariff and hoped that the issue would be resolved amicablywhen pointed that the enron board had taken a decision to serve the notice despi te statef s willingness to appoint a renegotiating committee chief ministe r said it was unfortunate earlier in his meeting with hazare deshmukh promised to make necessary amendments to the right to information law recently passed by the state so that the information was easily accessed by the common people he also gave a patient hearing to hazare on his complaints of corruption in various state departments and promised action against guilty after a thorough inquiry within three months afternoon april enrons on state govt to renegotiate dabhol power project by hubert vaz the us power giant enron power corporations willingness to wrap up the dabhol power project and leave the shores may not actually materialise though the dabhol power company chief mr wade cline has been authorised to do so since the lenders for the project would have a decisive say in the matter disclosing this chief minister vilasrao deshmukh confirmed this morning th at the state government would churn out a compromise formula by which the powe r project at dabhol could be continued and at the same time enron did not fe el slighted enron has not yet conveyed to us about this decision we are waiting for their letter he said when asked what sort of compromise the state government plans to forge mr deshmukh said let our officers come back after that we will decide a future course of action but we are definitely going in for renegotiation of the project it is very difficult to predict the outcome of enrons decision but as of now the project is still on when asked whether the project could be moved to another state if wou nd up from maharashtra mr deshmukh said that was not possible as per the terms of the agreement between the us company and the state government however it was difficult for the project to move out of the state itself he indicated he also confirmed that both parties would face considerable loss es if the project was terminated the board of directors of the dabhol power company which met in london on wednesday decided to put an end to all controversies surrounding the proje ct once and for all by empowering the dpc chief to terminate the project if h e deemed it fit however this decision as of now does not necessarily indicate the death knell for the project the enron project which had been riddled with controversies right from its inception had been a pretext for the political parties in the state to drag each other on the mat from time to time the previous senabjp government which had been out to terminate the project however chose to continue with it following renegotiations with enrons top visiting officials like ms rebecca mark and the democratic front government inherited the controversial project when the governments changed hands a year and a half ago meanwhile state energy minister dr padamsinh patil when contacted at the osmanabad circuit house said the state government and the central governme nt have decided to appoint a joint committee to renegotiate the project with enron it is not easy for them to walk out of the project just like that they will have to go in for litigation and this would prove costly for both sides he said in case the project is terminated the government can stil l manage the power needs of the state though it would be a bit tough job he added

httpwwwbusinessstandardcomtodaystateaspmenud mseb revenue collections up at rs crore in march renni abraham the financial expressapril godboles report unearths absurd calculations maharashtra could use th is to wriggle out of the dabhol project sucheta dalal it is finally quit india time for enron though the controversial multinational has denied plans to sell its stake in dabhol power company dpc informed sources say that it has sent feelers to china light power and others to offload its majority holdinggetting out of india may be the best course for enron though it has threatened a fight and invoked politic al force majeure the energy review committee headed by madhav godbole will certainly weaken its case the committee points out that the many infirmities in the dpc approval process brings into question the propriety of the decisions it is clear that the m that enron spent on educating indias policymakers and bureaucrats did not even teach them the basics of technoeconomic appraisal or due procedure with regard to large internation al contracts the committee says it is troubled with the failure of govern ance that seems to have characterised almost every step of the decision making process on matters relating to dpc the failure of governance has been broa d across different governments at different points of time at both the state and the central level and across different agencies associated with examining the project and at both the administrative and political levels it strains belief to accept that such widespread and consistent failure to execute assigned responsibilities is purely coincidental though the committee decided that it is not the proper forum to investigate these infirmities its two key members mr godbole and former secretary in the ministry of finance eas sarma have asked for a judicial inquiry into the process of clearing the dpc project other members felt a judicial inquiry would delay the negotiation process and not serve any purpose there may be some merit in an argument against a further delay in renegotiating tariffs or facilitating enrons exit but the report certa inly provides the central vigilance commission cvc with all the grounds that i t needs to start an investigation cvc n vittal has already received innumerable requests to investigate the deal especially the beneficiaries of its education campaign though the political establishment may be reluctant to set up a judicial inquiry the cvc can establish whether there are lapses on the part of government functionaries including political executives and ensure appropriate action against them if it is indeed able to establish undue influence in signing the contract then maharashtra may be able to get out of a deal patently against the public interest without any monetary liability the godbole committee has vindicated the stand of antienron activists who have been opposed it since negotiations began in it establishes that enron power is expensive per se and the project needs to be renegotiated regardless of the causes for the maharashtra state electricity boards mseb financial distress also that dpcs extortionate tariffs are not merely because of the steep rise in petroproduct prices and rupee depreciation b ut mainly on account of its sweetheart deal with the state government enron s contract is clearly onesided it deliberately uses expensive raw material ignoring world bank warnings has worked on fanciful demandsupply estimates and several legal requirements and permissions in fact the committee has found that the mseb has been paying enron rs crore more than it should every year this comprises overcharging of rs crore on account of the large regassification plant of which only per ce nt of the capacity is used for dpc theres also a rs crore extra billi ng to the mseb for shipping and harbour charges although the cost of these facilities had been included in the capital recovery charge by charging mo re than twice the operations maintenance rate stipulated by the government o f india enron collects approximately rs crore extra every year it has also been collecting rs crore every year through inflated fuel consumption claims enron has been charging at kcalkwh under the powe r purchase agreement ppa although the equipment manufacturer has guaranteed it a much lower consumption rate this gives it a fat fuel arbitrage opportunity at the cost of the people of maharashtra the committee has also pointed to the strange practice of using four different exchange rates for different aspects of the project negotiation a rate of rs per dollar was assumed for calculating debt service of rupee loans rs per dollar as reference rate for phasei rs per dolla r as reference rate for phaseii and a curious rs per dollar for calculati ng government of india tariff forcing a reduction of these excessive charges has nothing to do with contract cancellation all it needs is tough negotiation and public pressure on the political establishment the godbole committee has established that dpcs tariffs can easily be h alved if excess payments are eliminated and unfair conditions such as the dollarisation of payments the takeorpay clause and escrow facility whic h is in fact hampering msebs reform particularly in power distribution a re scrappedthe security of future payments to dpc under the restructured tari ff would be based on increased cash flows from a reformed distribution system the committee also gives enron a difficult escape route it says that if th e multinational finds the conditions for restructuring too onerous it should free mseb from its contractual obligations and find buyers outside maharashtra the committee has tried to establish another precedent on all projects negotiated by government the public has a right to know what is being contracted on their behalf and has recommended that all documents including contracts related to all independent power projects ipps particularly dpc should be published by the maharashtra government within two months also having established that demandsupply estimates by the state governme nt were fanciful the committee has asked mseb to defer all negotiations with power producers until demand levels in the state permit full absorption of power generation from such ipps it recommends that such negotiations shoul d be in accordance with the leastcost plan spelt out by the report this should also end the hectic lobbying by reliance patalganga mittals bhadravati the bses saphale and others to set up ipps in maharashtra the financial express april dpc board set to authorise president enron md to issue notice of termination sanjay jog scrapping of power purchase agreement the board of directors of dabhol power company dpc which has already tak en an aggressive posture has proposed to authorise the enron india managing director k wade cline and dpc president and chief executive officer neil mcgregor to issue notices for the termination of power purchase agreement ppa and transfer of dabhol project in view of continuing default by the state and central governments and maharashtra state electricity board mseb the board of directors which would meet on april in london also plans to appoint mr cline as its true and lawful attorneyinfact and author ise him to represent the company in the negotiation of all project contracts and financing agreements and their amendments and modificationstop sources tol d the financial express that dpc would authorise mr cline andor mr mcgregor to serve the preliminary termination notices and transfer notices to the state and central governments and mseb under clause and schedule of the ppa in response to the continuing default by the mseb of its payment obliga tions under the ppa the failure of the government of maharashtra to honour obligations under its guarantee and state support agreement and failure of the government of india to honour obligations under its counter guarantee the company has sought recourse to dispute resolution and has initiated conciliation and arbitration proceedings the company resolution said consistent with this recourse to contractual remedies the company now seeks the authority to serve preliminary termination notices and transfer notices pursuant to clause and schedule of the ppa from time to time and at a ny time upon the occurrence of an event giving rise to its right to serve such notices as determined by the company the resolution added according to the resolution the directors the company secretary and officers of the company and each of them acting individually are authorise d and empowered to execute and deliver such documents and instruments and tak e such other actions as they deem fit to effect the purpose of the resolution in the name and for and on behalf of the company against this backdrop th e state government and mseb have been exploring the possibilities of issuing termination notice to the dpc for its failure to meet the contractual obligations under the ppa the state government and mseb sources said that such a notice could be served by the mseb as dpc has not paid the rebate penalty of rs crore for misdeclaration and default on the availabilit y of power on january and february the state government and mseb which reviewed its position on saturday at a meeting convened by the chief minister vilasrao deshmukh are of the view that they have a strong case and substantial grounds to slap the terminatio n notice to the dpc the dpcs move to appoint mr k wade cline as its true and lawful attorneyinfact deserves importance especially when the state government proposes to set up a negotiating committee to cut the per unit cost and gauge the possibility of sale of dabhol power to the power deficit states mr cline would also be authorised to dispose of equipment that is worn out or obsolete or other equipment or fuel no longer expected to be used in the ordinary course in amounts exceeding rs crore or the equivalent in forei gn currency in any financial year furthermore mr cline would be in a positio n to enter into contracts and take any other actions for purpose

decision will be applicable to the existing phase i also the second phase of the project involves mw generation capacity whereas phase i of mw is already operationalaccording to the loan agreement even if only four per cent of the lenders agree to terminate the contract then dpc can do so highly placed sources in the lenders consortium said from london this in effect means that only one lender has to agree for dpc to serve a preliminary termination noticefollowing the notice there is a cooling off period of six months for both parties the mseb and dpc to find a mutually acceptable solution which may take the form of a renegotiated ppa source s added sources also said that there are two separate meetings scheduled wit h lenders the monday meeting will be attended by all the lenders

centre had decided to assist maharashtra upto rs crore every year to improve customer services outlook monday april the real story of dabhol if a judicial probe suggested by the committee i s ordered into the enron deal it could embarrass three governments ranjit bhushan the committee has prima facie found infirmities in several decisions taken in respect of the enron project at different points of time by successive governments and agencies in the centre and state energy review committee headed by former home secretary madhav godbole this could well be the real enron story a fivemember highpowered committee headed by madhav godboleand includ ing former union economic affairs secretary eas sarma hdfc chairman deepak parekh teri chairman rajendrapachauri and maharashtra government official vinay mohan lalhas recommended a judicial probe into the entire enron p ower project deal saying it signified the utter failure of governance that seem s to have characterised almost every step of the decisionmaking process relating to the dabhol project the report which was submitted to the maharashtra government last fortnight and has been acquired by outlook is severely critical of former chief minister sharad pawar with the congress then the day bjpled union government which reworked the deal in shiv sena supremo balasaheb thackeray and his government in maharashtra headed by manohar joshi the utter failure of governance seems to have characterised almost every step of decisionmaking relating to the dabhol project madhav godbole committee report an investigation if ordered could embarrass at least these three governments the report clearly upholds the allegations of money being paid by enron to politicians and bureaucrats for clinching the deal according to t he committee the deal reveals failure of governance both at the centre and state and across different agencies it strains belief to accept that suc h widespread and consistent failure to execute responsibilities is purely coincidental the report said proposing a set of measures to be implement ed if something of the project was to be retrieved godbole and sarma also fel t that the panel should categorically recommend the government of india to order a judicial inquiry this was finally adopted by it says a congress leader enron could well become the biggest political issue in maharashtra and put to question liberalisation particularly in the power sector the proposal has already struck panic says ncps praful patel if the enr on decision has at all been detrimental it is because of the haste with which phase was cleared by the shiv senabjp government now with the state having already entered into an agreement with enron the important thing is to resolve it amicably a judicial inquiry will be an eyewash because its not an issue of corruption but that of perception promarket congressmen privately admit that it was their governments at the centre and the state which invited enron even though the second phase was cleared by the bjpshiv sena combine says congress spokesperson jaipal reddy right now were too involved with the parliament deadlock over tehelka proliberalisation congress mps also fear that such witchhunting could send wrong signals to foreign investors noncongress mps from maharashtra meanwhile claim that the godbole committee was instituted wit h the express purpose of politicising the enron issue i think i know vilasr ao deshmukhs gameplan says an mp from the state but some mps like congress prithviraj chavan question the cloak of secrecy thats surrounded the deal ive maintained for long that there should be a judicial committee to examine this the committee report also says that had the enron project been subjected to a technoeconomic appraisal as envisaged under provisions of the electricity supply act of and related legislations the infirmities could have bee n avoidedsince this wasnt done questions about a concerted effort towards exercising undue influence at every stage of the project are bound to arise the exhaustive page report points out id highlight the speed with which the day vajpayee government cleared the project minutes before it quit says congress mp prithviraj chavan the enron project had been held out as an exemplar of the impending liberalisation in the early s and despite several controversies is now an established power project at dabhol km south of mumbai in july enron signed an mou with the maharashtra state electricity board mseb to set up a mw station as part of the governments fast track projects subsequently when the shivsenabjp came to power in maharashtra it filed a writ against the project this curiously led to renegotiations with enron the committee has quoted a bombay high court order on the renegotiated deal once it gom decided to revive the project it acted in the very same manner its predecessors in office had done it forgot all about competitive bidding and transparency the speed with which the negotiating group studie d the project and made its proposal for renegotiatons which was accepted by dabhol is unprecedented says chavan i would particularly like to highlight the speed with which the day vajpayee government at centre endorsed the renegotiated project minutes before it resigned since the commissioning of the plant in may the mseb has paid rs crore for the power it has bought from dabhol if the same watttage of powe r had been bought from indianbuilt power plants fired by indigenous coal th e payment would have been approximately rs crore in the first yearandahalf of its operation itself the dpc had drained the maharashtr a exchequer of nearly rs crore the central electricity authority cea in fact pointed out that the dabh ol plant was not the least costly option the mseb had other inexpensive alternatives like the four units of kaparkheda but they were in a preliminary stage the report notes if the mseb had made efforts to seriously pursue these projects they might not have remained in their preliminary stages it adds that the members were of the opinion that the mseb and the maharashtra government erred seriously based on information available at that time in proceeding with the dpc as a baseload factor ev en when its capacity was reduced the failure seems to have been compounded b y the laxity of the union power ministry finance ministry and the cea it quotes the cea as saying that since the union finance ministry found the tariff reasonable no further examination was required strangely bal thackerays shiv sena when it came to power together with t he bjp in maharashtra filed a writ in the court and then renegotiated the dea l after the new shiv senabjp government took over its cm manohar joshi appointed a renegotiating committee in which made the right noises actually managing to reduce the tariff but certain things remained inexplicable no fresh clearances were required from the cea which also sa id that since no cost increase was involvedfresh formal clearance wasnt necessary says the committee this only adds strength to the suspicion that the cea didnt consider the economic aspects of the project at all indeed given the nonavailability of any official record of the meeting on june with the committee and the nature of this letter dated december the committee is doubtful whether the economic aspects o f dpc were discussed at all the credibility of the shiv senabjp government has been seriously questioned the committee finds it unexplicable sic why there was no mention of any reduction in capital cost of the project from million to million as agreed by dpc in the summary report of the renegotiati ng committee the panel observessays lawyer prashant bhushan it is strange that the shiv senabjp government first filed a writ in the court and then coolly renegotiated the deal the committee further spells out the losses incurred through the deal subsequent to the commissioning of the dpc the financial deterioration of mseb has been rapid while the mseb was in profi t in it plunged into huge losses of rs crore in significantly the world bank in had predicted the systems inherent weaknesses in a letter written to the then power secretary r vasudevan a top bank official had said that after a detailed review of the analytical framework and costing assumptions we reconfirm our earlier conclusion that the dabhol project as presently formulated is not economically justified and that in our assessment the project is too large to enter the mseb syst em in the proposed baseload operation could result in uneconomic plant dispatch as already existing lower variable cost coal power would be replaced by the higher cost lng power enrons persistence and the gullibility of the indian side can be gauged from highranking enron official joe suttons letter to a key indian official ajit nimbalkar i recently met with the world bank and have been following the articles in the india papers i feel that the world bank opinion can be changed well engage a pr firm and hopefully manage the med ia from here on the project has solid support from all other agencies in washington the key question in the enron deal is whether a developed state like maharashtra needs outside intervention in the power sector at all for the first time the godbole committee has raised objections about the viability of such a project according to the report the mseb has been one of the bette r performing boards in the country and has despite a faulty transmission and distribution t and d system managed to consistently earn net revenue surpluses on an accrual basis maharashtra accounts for nearly onefourth of the gross value of indias industrial sector its one of the few states to achieve per cent electrification since the mseb has been adding to its generation th is improvement which has been largely due to renovation and modernisation undertaken by the mseb exceeded its own expectations at a time when the dp c was being considered the report points out following a policy of crosssubsidy roughly nine out of its ten users are subsidised but the gap between the average cost of supply and average realisation hasn t been much in fact the subsidy claim decreased from rs crore in to rs crore in until in it increased nearly fivefol d to rs crore due to the sudden increase in the gap by paise per uni t from to paisean increase of per cent the increase in the su bsidy claim by rs crore is due to the increase in the gap principally becau se of the increase in power purchase costs says the committee adding without the dpc and without problems of t and d loss the mseb could be financially healthy but can that happen now since enron is here to stay the committee has come up with some farreaching recommendations make public all dabholrelated documents and agreements restructure the dabhol project itself to bring do wn the cost of power restructure dpc financially allow sale of dpc power outside maharashtra reexamine ppas in accordance with leastcost plans a nd thoroughly reform the msebthe committee know this can become reality only with political consensus and through forming of public opinion the questio n is can that be achieved in an unstable political environment with priya sahgal making of a scam centre invites enron to set up fast track power project dec first ppa signed with mseb enron starts construction senabjp govt scraps enron state govt renegotiates project day vajpayee govt approves counterguarantee may state cabinet clears ppa may phase i commissioned jul financial closure for phase ii oct mseb defaults on payment subsequently stops paying monthly bil ls feb enron invokes central governments counterguarantee business standard monday april mseb revenue collections up at rs crore in march renni abraham the maharashtra state electricity boards mseb revenue collections in mar ch stood at a record rs crore this was largely due to the disconnection drive on defaulter connections pegged at nearly disconnections a month which resulted in compliance by consumers with t he dabhol power company dpc monthly financial burden issue now a topic of discussion among arbitrators on the negotiating table the mseb has turned to putting its house in order as if to ward of any criticism of its fiscal condition that could be termed as the facilitator to the entire dpc tariff crisis the state electricity board has put matters relating to its performance on record for instance mseb has recorded the highest power generation in the year ended march at units compared with the previous years units making it the top seb of the country in this respect similarly its power stations recorded the highest availability percentage at up from per cent last fiscal plant load factor is up to per cent compared with per cent in the parli power station has recorded the highest ever generation in the ten years of its life time in at million units which made it eligibl e for the meritorious productivity award under the eligibility guidelines issued by the government of india carrying a cash award of rs lakh al l other power stations in the state without exception also fulfill the eligibility criteria for the cash award a senior mseb official said similarly the chandrapur power station became the first power station of a ny state electricity board to get the iso certification a senior mseb official said earlier mseb was suffering from too much interference in its day to day functioning the agriculturists were touted as the major reason for its deteriorating accruals while theft of electricity during the transmission and distribution stage was conveniently camouflaged under this head in the recent past the government has authorised mseb to take steps to curb this misuse of power by its own officials many of whom including a chief engineer have suffered suspensions

mea n that the termination notice will be served immediately it is only an ena bling provision and will be used only if the situation arises a state gov ernment source told business standard from london he said dpc was under pr essure from its lenders the dpc spokesperson here refused to comment on the issue the hardening of the boards stand is in sharp contrast to the advice of dpcs lenders who had warned enron not to precipitate matters by issuing a termination notic e the lenders had arrived at a consensus that the termination notice need not be served at this stage serving of the notice requires a nod from the lenders who have an exposure of about billion in the project sources s aid given the lenders strong opposition to termination of the contract th e enron boards enabling

serve the termination notice and transfer not ices to mseb following wednesdays dpc board meeting in london the essence of the message from the international lenders following the lon don meeting with dpc board is emotions do not work contractual obligation s and payments have to be met we are convinced that the mseb has failed to meet its obligations there is no point in enron continuing with the proje ct and the company should get out of itthe structuring of dpcs debt has c reated two classes of lenders in phasei international lenders are covere d by a sovereign guarantee while in phaseii no lender is however all le nders have a parri passu charge making attachment of assets a messy affair sources in international banks were quick to point out that local lenders t o phaseii of the project are worried that an awry dpc project will affect their interests more given that they have no security other than assets like a sovereign cover it was this desperation that made local lenders l ike idbi slash the interest rates a few months back to per cent from per cent a leading foreign banker pointed outthree points that were made clear and stressed in no uncertain terms by international lenders were a there are contractual obligations b mseb was not punctual in its paym ents to dpc and c mseb adopted a confrontational position by slapping a rs crore rebate charge on dpc for misdeclaration and default on the avail ability of power while local lenders led by idbi with mseb parroting the same were of th e view that the current situation is a temporary one international lenders were steadfast that pulling out of the project is the only way out this i s despite the stance taken by idbi and mseb that authorisation for terminat ion given to mr cline and mr mcgregor was not called for international ban kers pointed out that they will now have to look at the issue of charges an d protection for their loans in the event of the power project being scrapp ed in its present formthe points of contention are a that phasei of dpc is backed by a sovereign guarantee b phaseii is not and c to the extent that phaseii is covered by assets cancellation of phaseii may see all a ssets even those under phasei getting attached therefore an examinat ion on the segregation of assets under phasei and phaseii is now warrante d pti adds in a significant move dpc board has

abandonment of the project by enron analysts have described the de cision as a procedural move consistent with dpcs negotiating strategy to recover overdue payments from the mseb after the company

renegotiation too late enron by mahesh vijapurkar mumbai april the enronsponsored dabhol power company which last nigh t authorised its local management to issue a notice of termination of its p ower purchase agreement ppa with the maharashtra state electricity board has decided to keep a stiff upper lip this in turn has stoked speculati on that the switching off of power from its phase i plant was imminent whi le in reality a lengthy procedure has to be followed as prescribed within the ppa as one source familiar with the ppa told the hindu ``it is not sudden deat h of the project and in all probability the dpc vexed with the developm ents including sharp and pointed observations by the godbole committee ha s chosen to only arm itself with a serious option ``this would only eventu ally come into effect it is not an overnight operation and a lot of legal work is involved apparently the dpc intends to do some armtwisting at the board of directors meeting in london which maharashtra was initiall y disinclined to attend but later used the forum to put across its contenti ons on the project the dpc squarely told the mseb nominees on the board th at the offer of renegotiation had come rather ``too late it also said it did not see any room for optimism about the outcome it did not however rule out the option of talks thus underscoring the possibility that the de cision to authorise termination was a new weapon the maharashtra chief minister mr vilasrao deshmukh had hoped that dpc w ould not take any ``harsh step which would cause lot of damage to the int erests of both the independent power producer and the government and today he expressed his dismay in fact the mandate of the team that went on the strength of its stake in the dpc was to put across the idea that negotiat ion was the requirement and not confrontation echo in ls the enron issue also echoed in the lok sabha today where the power minister mr suresh prabhu said that scrapping of the agreement would cost the ce ntre rs crores whose liability in the project agreement was limited the centres liability in case of termination is one years electricity b ill and a termination fee of million blow to fis the termination could prove to be a serious blow to the indian financial in stitutions fis which under the leadership of the idbi were trying to co nvince the other lenders of the

board the company however may not pull out of the proje ct yet considering its lenders who met on monday opposed such a move and favoured renegotiations sources present during both the meetings said tha t though foreign lenders supported enron on the termination issue domestic financial institutions led by the industrial development bank of india p revailed over the deliberations to oppose any such drastic move enron need s the lenders consent to file a pretermination notice for pulling out fro m the project the decision to empower dpc chief wade cline to issue a term ination notice was taken with six votes in favour against a single idbi vot e against such a move another significant development during the entire proceedings was that the financial institutions made it clear that further funding of phase ii of th e project will depend on the government of india assuring payment mechanism s institutions are yet to disburse about per cent of the sanctioned pac kage which is crucial for completing the phase ii expansion project ``the board has given powers to wade cline to issue a pretermination notice bu t the meeting quite unanimously felt the need of the hour is not to termina te the project but to initiate serious renegotiation proceedings said m seb chairman vinay bansal who attended the board meeting ``mseb presented their views to the board members and it was understood by enron which also included the rs crore penalty issue which is heading for arbitration p roceedings ``we have also made it clear that the tariff structure of enron is quite high and a downward revision of tariffs is unavoidable bansal a dded ``they cannot issue a termination notice without our consent since our expo sure in the project is quite large and the lenders should approve any plans in that direction said a top banker who was present during the lenders meet ``there is a general consensus that the project must be completed an d the proposal to terminate the ppa should be kept in abeyance he added the global arrangers for the dpc include anz investment bank credit suiss e first boston abnamro citibank and the state bank of india where all t hese parties conducted separate meetings with the company officials howeve r some bankers said the company can file a termination notice even if one lender with a minimum per cent exposure on the project favours such proce edings meanwhile in a clear reversal of roles maharashtra chief minister vilasra o deshmukh said that the state government was not keen on terminating the p pa ``we will ask them to refrain from taking any such harsh steps since th at would be bad news for all of us including dpc deshmukh said deshmuk h was echoing union power minister suresh prabhus sentiments who said tha t the government wanted an amicable settlement of the payment row he howe ver added that termination of the project would not hurt foreign investmen ts and dismissed warnings by analysts that winding up the billion pro ject would be a blow to indias efforts to woo foreign investors the dpc has already slapped one conciliation notice on the centre and three arbitration notices on the state government over

state energy ministry interpreted the dpc boards d ecision as a pressure tactic employed by the enron subsidiary to force the mseb to clear the pending power bills without any further delay through it s tough posture the dpc wants to make its position stronger before it can formally agree for renegotiations with the mseb the centre and the state government for cutting the price of power supplied by it to the state elect ricity board the sources said that the dpcs reported decision to authoris e its managing director to stop electricity supply to the mseb did not mean that the enron subsidiary would actually go ahead with the scrapping of th e power contract with the mseb if anything the dpcs reported decision is to mount additional pressure o n the mseb for clearance of pending power bills and put itself in a stronge r position in settling its dispute with the mseb as part of its plan to ar m itself with powers to break a contract in case situation goes beyond its control the dpc had recently served a political force majeure to the mseb the centre and the state government the sources saidnot surprisingly t he dpcs london decision comes on the heels of the maharashtra governments decision to set up a highlevel committee comprising representatives of t he mseb the centre and the state government to renegotiate with the enron s subsidiary company for reducing the cost of power supplied to the state electricity boardmeanwhile amidst the threat of a possible termination no tice hanging on its head the mseb on thursday made a protest payment of the rs crore disputed amount towards march bill of rs crore to d pc riday april the telegraph friday april enron signal to switch off dabhol power enron today took the first decisive step out of the controversyridden dabh ol power company when it won an authorisation from the companys board to s top sale of power to maharashtra state electricity board mseb the meeting of the company of which the houstonbased energy giant holds per cent and the mseb per cent was attended by state energy secretary v m lal and mseb technical director p paunikar and it came days after its lenders discussed payment problems and a possible terminationthe centres liability if enron decides to snap the agreement will be a years power b ill and a termination fee of million however the company will have to wait for six months from the day it serves the notice before it pulls th e plugthe centre shrugged off the move saying there would not be any adve rse effect on foreign investment in power if enron walks out we do not se e fdi inflows into the power sector being hit power minister suresh prabh u saidmseb officials said the ball is now in the court of dpc which said its corporate policy did not allow it to comment on proceedings at board me etings the decision coincided with a rs crore protest payment by the cashstrapped power board as part of the march bill worth rs crore there was speculation that mseb coughed up the amount to cool frayed temper s at enrons hub in houston and because it was rattled by the sudden turn of events in the past few days during which the dispute had come to a head mseb officials brushed away the allusions saying the cheque was ready on wednesday but could not be handed over to dpc because of the statewide ban dh we have a disputed payment of rs crore which will be taken up a t the disputeresolution forum a board official said last week dpc told the state government and mseb it would no longer accept protest payments i n a move to fortify its legal position mseb officials say bechtel and general electric the other partners who hol d around per cent in dpc are willing to go along with enron corp in ter minating the deal but financial institutions such as idbi are not game beca use it puts their loans at risk investments made by indian institutions ar e not covered under the centres and states counterguarantees unlike tho se made by international lendersmaharashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmu kh called enrons decision unfortunate we had told state government offic ials attending the enron board meeting to stop the company from winding up its operations in the state as it will harm both parties the statesman friday april enron threatens to pull out the enron crisis deepened with the board of directors of the dabhol power company deciding to authorise the managing director mr k wade cline to se rve a notice of termination on the contract for the first phase of the billion power projectthe decision which could lead to the cessation of d abhols power supply to the state was taken at the meeting held yesterday in london according to reports quoting the chairman of the maharashtra stat e electricity board mr vinay bansal while dpc officials refuse to comment on anything it is learnt that mseb w as itself prepared to serve a legal notice of termination just two days bef ore the meetingmseb was said to have been dissuaded by the nationalist con gress party president mr sharad pawar and union power minister mr suresh prabhu who had talks in new delhi with the maharashtra chief minister mr vilasrao deshmukh and an mseb delegation last monday the state government has been served two arbitration notices while the cent re is ready to go for conciliation with the dpc for failing to honour its c ounterguaranteefurther the dpc has already slapped a notice of political force majeure which protects itself against undeserved claims in the event of exigencies that force it to take an extreme stepthe union power minist er mr suresh prabhu contended in delhi that since dpc contributed only per cent of the total energy output of the country its termination would not have such a phenomenal impact on the power situation however if terminations proceedings go through enron corp a per cent shareholder in the dabhol power company would stand to net a hefty amount in damages the union power secretary has been quoted as saying that termi nation of the dpc would cost the centre rs crore which is the total of one years electricity bill and a termination fee of million accor ding to an energy analyst mr pradyumna kaul the total liability would not cross rs crore however mr prabhu said in the lok sabha today that the that scrapping of the agreement would cost the centre rs croreit is learnt that on april mr deshmukh had given the goahead to the mseb to prepare a legal notice to be issued to enron during the meeting of the dpc s board of directors on wednesday at the meeting the energy minister pa damsinh patil energy secretary mr vinay mohan lal and mseb chairman mr vi nay bansal were also presentthe notice was prepared over the past weekend and taken by the delegation when they called on mr prabhu on april how ever the politicians convinced them that enron would not get tough given its huge stake in the project and that such a notice would not be necessar y the meeting thus ended with the decision to renegotiate the power tariff with enrons consent among those present at the london meeting were mr lal mr bansal and mseb t echnical director mr p paunikar in their capacity as directors however they abstained from voting since they were deemed an interested party the only vote to go against the decision was that of the idbi which is also rep resented on the board it is learntthe chief minister mr vilasrao deshmuk h said the state was not in favour of terminating the project this could mean that the latest manoeuvre to armtwist the indian authorities could ac hieve its immediate target of getting the arrears accumulated over the past three months clearedthe mseb owes enron rs crore for march an d rs crore for december and january the centre today put up a brave face on enrons decision saying there would not be any adverse effec t on foreign investment in power sector in the country pti reported from n ew delhi there will be no adverse impact as a result of any action by any domestic or foreign company as far as we are concerned there will be no adverse imp act on fdi in power sector power minister suresh prabhu told reporters wh en asked about dpcs decision to authorise management to issue a terminatio n notice to msebemphasising that there would be no fallout of such decisio n prabhu said after the meeting of the cabinet committee on economic affai rs we are expecting cooperation from many scandinavian countries as well a s european nations in the power sectorin fact not only the power minister but also the prime minister of norway was here to inaugurate a seminar on power and he promised lot of cooperation in the sector mid day dpc may not wind up maharashtra chief secretary v ranganathan has said that though neil mcgrego r managing director of the dabhol power corporation dpc has been given complete powers with regard to dpcs operations in the state including the authority to wind up operations it does not necessarily mean that mcgrego r will issue such a termination notice mcgregor was given the powers at a meeting of the dpc board in london on wednesday ranganathan said that stat e officials including maharashtra state electricity board mseb chairman vinay bansal and power secretary v m lal have reported back to him about t he meeting in london with regard to the states failure to pay enron ranganathan said bills are prepared as per the power purchase agreement ppa and dpc owes some mo ney to us our people informed enron officials about this in fact there was no reason to give powers to the md to slap a termination noticein the london meeting mseb and industrial development bank of india idbi repre sentatives insisted that the dpc must pay rs crore since it could not s upply power whenever needed chief minister vilasrao deshmukh has already termed as unfortunate the deci sion of the board of the enronpromoted dpc to give mcgregor powers to wind up operations deshmukh added we have already requested enron not to ta ke any harsh decisiondeshmukh had earlier said we have directed state government officials attending the dpc board meeting to desist the energy c ompany from winding up operations in the state as it would be harmful to b oth of us enron officials are keeping mum on the issue mcgregor said i am not goi ng to give any comment mid day april enron offers no comment on renegotiation h s rao a crucial meeting of the board of directors of the dabhol power company dp c promoted by the us energy major enron was held here yesterday apparent ly to discuss fate of its million power project in maharashtra but th ere was no official word on the indian and state governments decision to r enegotiate the contract an enron spokesman declined to divulge what transpired at the meeting sayi ng the issues discussed at the meeting were confidential we have not received any direct communication unless we get it and evaluate the detail s we have no comments to make the spokesman said when asked about the pr oposed decision on renegotiation of the project in which the maharashtra s tate electricity board mseb has per cent stake asked whether the board had taken a decision on empowering dpc managing dir ector neil mcgregor to wind up its operations in india the spokesman said he had nothing to say on them enron has reportedly authorised mcgregor to look at various options including selling the companys stake in dpc mahar ashtra chief minister vilasrao deshmukh said in mumbai that the state gover nment would pay up the undisputed dues to the company he said the maharash tra government is not in favour of terminating the mw project but w anted an amicable solution to the imbroglio mid day friday april committee to renegotiate enron deal a committee to renegotiate the power purchase agreement with the dabhol pow er company will be appointed by this evening chief minister vilasrao deshm ukh said today addressing media persons after his meeting with the noted s ocial reformer anna hazare at his official residence varsha deshmukh said the committee would be formed by this evening or by tomorrow at the mosth e termed as unfortunate the enron board decision empowering dpc chief neil mcgregor to serve a preliminary termination notice on the maharashtra state electricity board and said the state was willing to negotiate the issue wi th power company renegotiations will be held as per the suggestions made by the godbole co mmittee and the center will also depute its representative on the renegotia ting committee we dont want to take any hasty decision deshmukh saidhe pointed that the only bone of contention with the dpc had been its expensiv e tariff and hoped that the issue would be resolved amicablywhen pointed t hat the enron board had taken a decision to serve the notice despite state s willingness to appoint a renegotiating committee chief minister said it was unfortunate earlier in his meeting with hazare deshmukh promised to make necessary am endments to the right to information law recently passed by the state so th at the information was easily accessed by the common people he also gave a patient hearing to hazare on his complaints of corruption in various state departments and promised action against guilty after a thorough inquiry wi thin three months afternoon april enrons on state govt to renegotiate dabhol power project by hubert vaz the us power giant enron power corporations willingness to wrap up the da bhol power project and leave the shores may not actually materialise thoug h the dabhol power company chief mr wade cline has been authorised to do so since the lenders for the project would have a decisive say in the mat ter disclosing this chief minister vilasrao deshmukh confirmed this morning th at the state government would churn out a compromise formula by which the p ower project at dabhol could be continued and at the same time enron did n ot feel slighted enron has not yet conveyed to us about this decision we are waiting for their letter he said when asked what sort of compromise the state government plans to forge mr deshmukh said let our officers come back after that we will decide a future course of action but we are definitely going in for renegotiation of the project it is very difficult to predict the outcome of enrons decision but as of now the project is sti ll on when asked whether the project could be moved to another state if wound up from maharashtra mr deshmukh said that was not possible as per the terms of the agreement between the us company and the state government however it was difficult for the project to move out of the state itself he indicated he also confirmed that both parties would face considerable losses if the project was terminated the board of directors of the dabhol power company which met in london on wednesday decided to put an end to all controversies surrounding the proje ct once and for all by empowering the dpc chief to terminate the project i f he deemed it fit however this decision as of now does not necessarily indicate the death knell for the project the enron project which had bee n riddled with controversies right from its inception had been a pretext f or the political parties in the state to drag each other on the mat from ti me to time the previous senabjp government which had been out to termina te the project however chose to continue with it following renegotiations with enrons top visiting officials like ms rebecca mark and the democr atic front government inherited the controversial project when the governme nts changed hands a year and a half ago meanwhile state energy minister dr padamsinh patil when contacted at the osmanabad circuit house said the state government and the central governm ent have decided to appoint a joint committee to renegotiate the project wi th enron it is not easy for them to walk out of the project just like tha t they will have to go in for litigation and this would prove costly for b oth sides he said in case the project is terminated the government can still manage the power needs of the state though it would be a bit tough j ob he added

use this to wriggle out of the dabhol project sucheta dalal it is finally quit india time for enron though the controversial multinati onal has denied plans to sell its stake in dabhol power company dpc info rmed sources say that it has sent feelers to china light power and others to offload its majority holdinggetting out of india may be the best cours e for enron though it has threatened a fight and invoked political force m ajeure the energy review committee headed by madhav godbole will certainly weaken its case the committee points out that the many infirmities in t he dpc approval process brings into question the propriety of the decision s it is clear that the m that enron spent on educating indias policymak ers and bureaucrats did not even teach them the basics of technoeconomic a ppraisal or due procedure with regard to large international contracts the committee says it is troubled with the failure of governance that seems t o have characterised almost every step of the decision making process on ma tters relating to dpc the failure of governance has been broad across dif ferent governments at different points of time at both the state and the c entral level and across different agencies associated with examining the p roject and at both the administrative and political levels it strains beli ef to accept that such widespread and consistent failure to execute assigne d responsibilities is purely coincidental though the committee decided that it is not the proper forum to investigate these infirmities its two key members mr godbole and former secretary i n the ministry of finance eas sarma have asked for a judicial inquiry int o the process of clearing the dpc project other members felt a judicial in quiry would delay the negotiation process and not serve any purpose ther e may be some merit in an argument against a further delay in renegotiating tariffs or facilitating enrons exit but the report certainly provides th e central vigilance commission cvc with all the grounds that it needs to start an investigation cvc n vittal has already received innumerable requests to investigate the d eal especially the beneficiaries of its education campaign though the pol itical establishment may be reluctant to set up a judicial inquiry the cvc can establish whether there are lapses on the part of government function aries including political executives and ensure appropriate action again st them if it is indeed able to establish undue influence in signing the contract then maharashtra may be able to get out of a deal patently again st the public interest without any monetary liability the godbole committee has vindicated the stand of antienron activists who have been opposed it since negotiations began in it establishes that enron power is expensive per se and the project needs to be renegotiated regardless of the causes for the maharashtra state electricity boards ms eb financial distress also that dpcs extortionate tariffs are not merely because of the steep rise in petroproduct prices and rupee depreciation but mainly on account of its sweetheart deal with the state government enr ons contract is clearly onesided it deliberately uses expensive raw mate rial ignoring world bank warnings has worked on fanciful demandsupply e stimates and several legal requirements and permissions in fact the committee has found that the mseb has been paying enron rs crore more than it should every year this comprises overcharging of rs crore on account of the large regassification plant of which only per cent of the capacity is used for dpc theres also a rs crore extra bil ling to the mseb for shipping and harbour charges although the cost of thes e facilities had been included in the capital recovery charge by charging more than twice the operations maintenance rate stipulated by the governm ent of india enron collects approximately rs crore extra every year i t has also been collecting rs crore every year through inflated fuel co nsumption claims enron has been charging at kcalkwh under the power purchase agreement ppa although the equipment manufacturer has guaranteed it a much lower consumption rate this gives it a fat fuel arbitrage oppor tunity at the cost of the people of maharashtra the committee has also pointed to the strange practice of using four differ ent exchange rates for different aspects of the project negotiation a rate of rs per dollar was assumed for calculating debt service of rupee loan s rs per dollar as reference rate for phasei rs per dollar as reference rate for phaseii and a curious rs per dollar for calculating government of india tariff forcing a reduction of these excessive charges has nothing to do with contract cancellation all it needs is tough negoti ation and public pressure on the political establishment the godbole committee has established that dpcs tariffs can easily be halv ed if excess payments are eliminated and unfair conditions such as the doll arisation of payments the takeorpay clause and escrow facility which is in fact hampering msebs reform particularly in power distribution are sc rappedthe security of future payments to dpc under the restructured tariff would be based on increased cash flows from a reformed distribution system the committee also gives enron a difficult escape route it says that if the multinational finds the conditions for restructuring too onerous it sh ould free mseb from its contractual obligations and find buyers outside mah arashtra the committee has tried to establish another precedent on all pro jects negotiated by government the public has a right to know what is bei ng contracted on their behalf and has recommended that all documents incl uding contracts related to all independent power projects ipps particula rly dpc should be published by the maharashtra government within two month s also having established that demandsupply estimates by the state governme nt were fanciful the committee has asked mseb to defer all negotiations wi th power producers until demand levels in the state permit full absorption of power generation from such ipps it recommends that such negotiations sh ould be in accordance with the leastcost plan spelt out by the report thi s should also end the hectic lobbying by reliance patalganga mittals bh adravati the bses saphale and others to set up ipps in maharashtra the financial express april dpc board set to authorise president enron md to issue notice of terminati on sanjay jog scrapping of power purchase agreement the board of directors of dabhol power company dpc which has already tak en an aggressive posture has proposed to authorise the enron india managin g director k wade cline and dpc president and chief executive officer neil mcgregor to issue notices for the termination of power purchase agreement ppa and transfer of dabhol project in view of continuing default by the st ate and central governments and maharashtra state electricity board mseb the board of directors which would meet on april in london also plans to appoint mr cline as its true and lawful attorneyinfact and authorise him to represent the company in the negotiation of all project contracts a nd financing agreements and their amendments and modificationstop sources told the financial express that dpc would authorise mr cline andor mr mcgr egor to serve the preliminary termination notices and transfer notices to t he state and central governments and mseb under clause and schedule o f the ppa in response to the continuing default by the mseb of its payment obligatio ns under the ppa the failure of the government of maharashtra to honour ob ligations under its guarantee and state support agreement and failure of th e government of india to honour obligations under its counter guarantee th e company has sought recourse to dispute resolution and has initiated conci liation and arbitration proceedings the company resolution said consist ent with this recourse to contractual remedies the company now seeks the a uthority to serve preliminary termination notices and transfer notices purs uant to clause and schedule of the ppa from time to time and at any t ime upon the occurrence of an event giving rise to its right to serve such notices as determined by the company the resolution added according to the resolution the directors the company secretary and offic ers of the company and each of them acting individually are authorised and empowered to execute and deliver such documents and instruments and take s uch other actions as they deem fit to effect the purpose of the resolution in the name and for and on behalf of the company against this backdrop t he state government and mseb have been exploring the possibilities of issui ng termination notice to the dpc for its failure to meet the contractual ob ligations under the ppa the state government and mseb sources said that su ch a notice could be served by the mseb as dpc has not paid the rebate pen alty of rs crore for misdeclaration and default on the availability of power on january and february the state government and mseb which reviewed its position on saturday at a meeting convened by the chief minister vilasrao deshmukh are of the view that they have a strong case and substantial grounds to slap the terminatio n notice to the dpc the dpcs move to appoint mr k wade cline as its true and lawful attorneyinfact deserves importance especially when the state government proposes to set up a negotiating committee to cut the per unit cost and gauge the possibility of sale of dabhol power to the power deficit states mr cline would also be authorised to dispose of equipment that is worn out or obsolete or other equipment or fuel no longer expected to be used in the ordinary course in amounts exceeding rs crore or the equivalent in fore ign currency in any financial year furthermore mr cline would be in a pos ition to enter into contracts and take any other actions for purpose relati ng to the daytoday operation of the companys business or exercise its ri ghts and discharge its obligations under the project

services outlook monda y april the real story of dabhol if a judicial probe suggested by the committee i s ordered into the enron deal it could embarrass three governments ranj it bhushan the committee has prima facie found infirmities in several decisions taken in respect of the enron project at different points of time by successive governments and agencies in the centre and state energy review committee headed by former home secretary madhav godbole this could well be the real enron story a fivemember highpowered committee headed by madhav godboleand including former union economic affairs secretary eas sarma hdfc chairman deepak parekh teri chairman rajendrapachauri and maharashtra government official vinay mohan lalhas recommended a judicial probe into the entire enron pow er project deal saying it signified the utter failure of governance that s eems to have characterised almost every step of the decisionmaking process relating to the dabhol project the report which was submitted to the ma harashtra government last fortnight and has been acquired by outlook is se verely critical of former chief minister sharad pawar with the congress th en the day bjpled union government which reworked the deal in s hiv sena supremo balasaheb thackeray and his government in maharashtra head ed by manohar joshi the utter failure of governance seems to have characterised almost every s tep of decisionmaking relating to the dabhol project madhav godbole comm ittee report an investigation if ordered could embarrass at least these three governme nts the report clearly upholds the allegations of money being paid by enron to politicians and bureaucrats for clinching the deal according to the co mmittee the deal reveals failure of governance both at the centre and sta te and across different agencies it strains belief to accept that such w idespread and consistent failure to execute responsibilities is purely coin cidental the report said proposing a set of measures to be implemented i f something of the project was to be retrieved godbole and sarma also felt that the panel should categorically recommend the government of india to o rder a judicial inquiry this was finally adopted by it says a congress le ader enron could well become the biggest political issue in maharashtra a nd put to question liberalisation particularly in the power sector the proposal has already struck panic says ncps praful patel if the enr on decision has at all been detrimental it is because of the haste with wh ich phase was cleared by the shiv senabjp government now with the state having already entered into an agreement with enron the important thing i s to resolve it amicably a judicial inquiry will be an eyewash because it s not an issue of corruption but that of perception promarket congressmen privately admit that it was their governments at the centre and the state which invited enron even though the second phase was cleared by the bjpshiv sena combine says congress spokesperson jaipal re ddy right now were too involved with the parliament deadlock over tehel ka proliberalisation congress mps also fear that such witchhunting coul d send wrong signals to foreign investors noncongress mps from maharashtr a meanwhile claim that the godbole committee was instituted with the expr ess purpose of politicising the enron issue i think i know vilasrao deshm ukhs gameplan says an mp from the state but some mps like congress pri thviraj chavan question the cloak of secrecy thats surrounded the deal i ve maintained for long that there should be a judicial committee to examin e this the committee report also says that had the enron project been subjected to a technoeconomic appraisal as envisaged under provisions of the electric ity supply act of and related legislations the infirmities could have been avoidedsince this wasnt done questions about a concerted effort to wards exercising undue influence at every stage of the project are bound to arise the exhaustive page report points out id highlight the speed with which the day vajpayee government cleared the project minutes before it quit says congress mp prithviraj chavan the enron project had been held out as an exemplar of the impending liberal isation in the early s and despite several controversies is now an est ablished power project at dabhol km south of mumbai in july enr on signed an mou with the maharashtra state electricity board mseb to set up a mw station as part of the governments fast track projects subsequently when the shivsenabjp came to power in maharashtra it filed a writ against the project this curiously led to renegotiations with enron the committee has quoted a bombay high court order on the renegotiated de al once it gom decided to revive the project it acted in the very sam e manner its predecessors in office had done it forgot all about competiti ve bidding and transparency the speed with which the negotiating group stu died the project and made its proposal for renegotiatons which was accepte d by dabhol is unprecedented says chavan i would particularly like to highlight the speed with which the day vajpayee government at centre end orsed the renegotiated project minutes before it resigned since the commissioning of the plant in may the mseb has paid rs crore for the power it has bought from dabhol if the same watttage of po wer had been bought from indianbuilt power plants fired by indigenous coal the payment would have been approximately rs crore in the first year andahalf of its operation itself the dpc had drained the maharashtra ex chequer of nearly rs crore the central electricity authority cea in fact pointed out that the dabh ol plant was not the least costly option the mseb had other inexpensive al ternatives like the four units of kaparkheda but they were in a preliminar y stage the report notes if the mseb had made efforts to seriously pu rsue these projects they might not have remained in their preliminary stag es it adds that the members were of the opinion that the mseb and the ma harashtra government erred seriously based on information available at tha t time in proceeding with the dpc as a baseload factor even when its capa city was reduced the failure seems to have been compounded by the laxity of the union power ministry finance ministry and the cea it quotes the ce a as saying that since the union finance ministry found the tariff reasonab le no further examination was required strangely bal thackerays shiv sena when it came to power together with t he bjp in maharashtra filed a writ in the court and then renegotiated the deal after the new shiv senabjp government took over its cm manohar joshi ap pointed a renegotiating committee in which made the right noises actu ally managing to reduce the tariff but certain things remained inexplicabl e no fresh clearances were required from the cea which also said that si nce no cost increase was involvedfresh formal clearance wasnt necessary says the committee this only adds strength to the suspicion that the c ea didnt consider the economic aspects of the project at all indeed give n the nonavailability of any official record of the meeting on june with the committee and the nature of this letter dated december the committee is doubtful whether the economic aspects of dpc were discu ssed at all the credibility of the shiv senabjp government has been seriously question ed the committee finds it unexplicable sic why there was no mention of any reduction in capital cost of the project from million to million as agreed by dpc in the summary report of the renegotiating committ ee the panel observessays lawyer prashant bhushan it is strange that t he shiv senabjp government first filed a writ in the court and then coolly renegotiated the deal the committee further spells out the losses incurr ed through the deal subsequent to the commissioning of the dpc the finan cial deterioration of mseb has been rapid while the mseb was in profit in it plunged into huge losses of rs crore in significantly the world bank in had predicted the systems inherent w eaknesses in a letter written to the then power secretary r vasudevan a top bank official had said that after a detailed review of the analytical framework and costing assumptions we reconfirm our earlier conclusion tha t the dabhol project as presently formulated is not economically justifie d and that in our assessment the project is too large to enter the mseb s ystem in the proposed baseload operation could result in uneconomic plant dispatch as already existing lower variable cost coal power would be replaced by the higher cost lng power enrons persistence and the gullibility of the indian side can be gauged from highranking enron official joe suttons letter to a key indian offici al ajit nimbalkar i recently met with the world bank and have been follo wing the articles in the india papers i feel that the world bank opinion c an be changed well engage a pr firm and hopefully manage the media from h ere on the project has solid support from all other agencies in washington the key question in the enron deal is whether a developed state like mahara shtra needs outside intervention in the power sector at all for the first time the godbole committee has raised objections about the viability of suc h a project according to the report the mseb has been one of the better p erforming boards in the country and has despite a faulty transmission and distribution t and d system managed to consistently earn net revenue sur pluses on an accrual basis maharashtra accounts for nearly onefourth of the gross value of indias in dustrial sector its one of the few states to achieve per cent electri fication since the mseb has been adding to its generation this impr ovement which has been largely due to renovation and modernisation underta ken by the mseb exceeded its own expectations at a time when the dpc was b eing considered the report points out following a policy of crosssubsid y roughly nine out of its ten users are subsidised but the gap between the average cost of supply and average realisation hasn t been much in fact the subsidy claim decreased from rs crore in to rs crore in until in it increased nearly fiv efold to rs crore due to the sudden increase in the gap by paise per unitfrom to paisean increase of per cent the increase in the subsidy claim by rs crore is due to the increase in the gap princ ipally because of the increase in power purchase costs says the committee adding without the dpc and without problems of t and d loss the mseb c ould be financially healthy but can that happen now since enron is here to stay the committee has come up with some farreaching recommendations make public all dabholrelated documents and agreements restructure the dabhol project itself to bring do wn the cost of power restructure dpc financially allow sale of dpc power outside maharashtra reexamine ppas in accordance with leastcost plans a nd thoroughly reform the msebthe committee know this can become reality on ly with political consensus and through forming of public opinion the ques tion is can that be achieved in an unstable political environment with priya sahgal making of a scam centre invites enron to set up fast track power project dec first ppa

revenue collections up at rs crore in march renni abraham the maharashtra state electricity boards mseb revenue collections in mar ch stood at a record rs crore this was largely due to the disconn

discussio n among arbitrators on the negotiating table the mseb has turned to puttin g its house in order as if to ward of any criticism of its fiscal condition that could be termed as the facilitator to the entire dpc tariff crisis the state electricity board has put matters relating to its performance on record for instance mseb has recorded the highest power generation in the year ended march at units compared with the previous years units making it the top seb of the country in this respect similarly its power station s recorded the highest availability percentage at up from per cen t last fiscal plant load factor is up to per cent compared with per cent in the parli power station has recorded the highest ever generation in the ten years of its life time in at million units which made it eligib le for the meritorious productivity award under the eligibility guidelines issued by the government of india carrying a cash award of rs lakh al l other power stations in the state without exception also fulfill the el igibility criteria for the cash award a senior mseb official said similar ly the chandrapur power station became the first power station of any stat e electricity board to get the iso certification a senior mseb official said earlier mseb was suffering from too much inte rference in its day to day functioning the agriculturists were touted as t he major reason for its deteriorating accruals while theft of electricity during the transmission and distribution stage was conveniently camouflaged under this head in the recent past the government has authorised mseb to take steps to curb this misuse of power by its own officials many of whom including a chief engineer have suffered suspensions

ei ::::::>>>>>> news article on enron india enron aftermath business line abhay mehta copyright c kasturi sons ltd ksl source world reporter tm asia intelligence wire power play a study of the enron project publishers orient longman new delhi price rs the enron power project at dabhol in ratnagiri district of maharashtra has been mired in nationwide controversy ever since the inception of the project proposal in and the sordid tale ends only in with the supreme court of india refusing to even admit an appeal against the bombay high court decision of december which while commenting that this case has highlighted to the people as to how even after years of independence political considerations outweigh the public interest and the interest of the state and to what extent the government can go to justify its actions not only before the public but even before the courts of law yet dismissed a public interest petition against the project on the purely technical ground of res judicata even though new facts new arguments new evidence of the violation of the laws of the land had been advanced by the petitioners the fact that the fresh violations of the law were not even considered and recorded despite the petitioners adducing the required evidence can only be termed as strange perhaps bizarre abhay mehtas simple factual documentation in fact a chronological narration of all events including the process of bending all rules of subverting the law for promoting a project involving unparalleled future liabilities for maharashtra indeed for the whole of india is not only masterly it is devastating it is a short pithy book which deserves to be read from cover to cover by all thinking citizens of this country barring the concluding chapter the epilogue there are no personal comments only facts disseminated from the original papers mostly secret documents all documentation has been carefully faithfully recorded including extracts from supposedly top secret minutes of cabinet committee meetings and the specific violations of the law which were opposed by a few public spirited civil servants much to their disadvantage have been pointed up apart from an introductory primer on electricity introduced for the benefit of the layman explaining some technical issues relating to electricity generation transmission and distribution and the background of the events of the foreign exchange crisis and the aftermath of the crisis the other fifteen chapters three appendices and fourteen annexes of the small book of pages packs in an enormous volume of factual information the strange saga of the enron project and the sheer magnitude of the future problems this one single project poses for the country need to be briefly recounted here for essentially it is the coming generation which would have to face the problem the mseb has contracted to buy and if not used to pay for mw of electricity for a period of years from the dabhol power company the legal entity set up by enron as an unlimited liability company registered in india through a maze of intricate crossholdings of equity by half a dozen or more front companies registered in various taxfree havens abhay mehta has indicated the total payments to enron over years amount to billion at exchange rates around rs crores over the life of the project one must record that a crude oiloil product prices have as of writing more than doubled since the above calculations were made a per the doctored figures presented by the company and its advocate the charge per unit of electricity supplied at the level of prices was to cent per unit as capacity charge and cents per unit for energy costs the former is indexed to the us inflation rate and the latter to international fuel prices the former may be assumed to have gone up only marginally rounded to cents per unit we know that fuel prices have more than doubled internationally over assuming the fuel costs to have increased less than per cent even though international prices have more than doubled we may assume for energy costs of cents per units making for a total payment of us cents per unit of electricity supplied by the dabhol power company dpc to mseb in late in phase i of the project within another two years at mw the annual offtake for days x hoursday would be billion kwh and at cents per unit the total payment amounts to billion annually for years this workout to billion this is not counting any further inflation in either energy costs or capacity charge at todays exchange rate about rs per us dollar in rupee terms this works out to wore than rs crores as compared to rs crores indicated by abhay mehta this is the cost to mseb in rupee and to the country in foreign exchange as payment to just one project authority for supply of part of the power required in maharashtra the really significant point to note in this connection is that this payment and considerably more depending on a future increase incapacity charges depending on us inflation rate and international prices of lngaphtha for fuel costs and b depreciation of the exchange rate of the rupee visavis the us dollar is obligatory the assets of the mseb the maharashtra government indeed all assets of the government of india present and future are mortgaged to enron by way of sovereign guarantees extended by both governments the other significant point in this connection is that as predicted by all independent indian experts as well as the world bank the enron project he forced the mseb to cut its offtake of tata electric companys and its own much cheaper thermal power already in a postscript dated august abhay mehta has indicated that already the mseb had stopped buying between and mw of power from tata electric available at rs per unit and has had to backdown its own chandrapur thermal power station cost of this power being rs per unit while forced to buy more expensive enron power at rs per unit the loss to mseb on this count alone comes to rs crore per year this had in fact been predicted earlier even by the world bank it is pointless here to go into the details of how precisely all this was contrived by a deliberate campaign of disinformation of blatant lies of sidelining of expert opinion not only of independent experts but also the gois own official advisers in this matter namely the central electricity authority as well as that of the world bank which was resolutely opposed to this project the detailed facts the letters exchanged in the above context the pressure tactics adopted the flouting of all procedures norms even statutory provisions of the electricity supply act are all carefully documented by abhay mehta mehta correctly concludes we frequently blame external agencies like the world bank for all our problems when as a matter of fact we ourselves are our own worst enemies in the instant case the world bank not only advised the government of india against the project it stood resolutely firm in its assessment of the total inadvisability of this project in fact one must note here that in neighbouring pakistan which had entered into a somewhat similar mou with enron cancelled the project and the power purchase agreement with enron for a million mw residual oilfuelled power plant even though that agreement had stipulated enron power supply at a fixed rate of us cents per kwh over a year period note the estimated rate of cents per kwh for dabhol power for the mseb in december which works out to around rs per unit one could go on but one must leave the reader to go through abhay mehtas crisp factual matter of fact narration of the enron saga and switch over to the point made by him in the epilogue to the story about the next round of scams for quite some time the ruling elite in india has been intent on privatising all public enterprises and even utilities are no exception the unbundling of infrastructure with a view to privatisation of all the profitable segments all this as per the current disinformation campaign is supposedly in the interest of rationalisation and greater efficiency of poorer supply the author has referred in this context to the acquisition from the government by the torrent group of the ahmedabad and surat electricity companies at less than onetenth of the market value of the assets of thee facilities again much like the enron saga all objections by the finance department of the gujarat government were overruled and abhay mehta has predicated that this onslaught the breakup of power utilities into three segments generation transmission and distribution with a view to their privatisation is likely to be the new thrust by the ruling elite for reasons that do not require to be spelt out though mehta had the examples of the torrent group takeover of ahmedabad and surat electricity companies and of the break up of the orissa state electricity board before him yet his statement can be stated today to be prophetic the upseb is now on the firing line the recent strike by the workers and engineers of the upseb in protest of the announced up government decision to trifurcate the upseb and the union minister of power mr rangarajan kumaramangalams statement that the upseb is a loss making inefficient unit and that privatisation of the facilities after the trifurcation need to be noted that per cent of the dues of the upseb are from the up government that tariffs for up electricity supply are fixed by the up government and not by the upseb that the upseb does not have the cash even for routine maintenance as a result of the above these are facts that nobody is prepared even to consider that the remedy for upseb lies in a different kind of reform and restructuring is not even to be debated the whole idea is to privatise the profitable segments and to leave the public sector entity with all the problem areas including rural energy supply it is against this background that abhay mehtas book needs to be widely disseminated read and its implications understood what is at stake is not a utility here or a psu there what is at stake is the future of some per cent of the havenots in this country what is at stake is the pillory of the assets of the nation for private aggrandisement arun ghosh

although the future of the project is still pretty uncertain with the lende rs unwilling to continue disbursements unless payment obligations are not honoured and contractual obligations left unfulfilled the veto exercised a t this juncture by the chairman of the parent company has come as a big boost to the indian venture company sources said we do not know what went on there but it is true that as of now we are not pulling out with the engineering procurement and construction contractors ge and equipment suppliers bechtel too in a cautious mode mode dpc was finding it even mor e difficult to continue the construction of the project as per the schedules sources said the stand taken by the rest of the directors on the board woul d be in view of the backlash that the company would have to face from its shareholders if the project actually floppedenron had similar bitter experiences in pakistan and it was difficult for the parent company to then justify such investments to the shareholders enron which had planned a major investments in indias infrastructure sectors such as oil and gas lng gas transportation telecom and broadband network has already pulled out most of

ga power project directly to third parties if the maharashtra state electricity board mseb does not lift power the projects power purch ase agreement ppa has a clause to this effect the state governments permission to reliance to hawk power to third parties has to be seen in th e context of its dithering on forwarding to the centre the dabhol power companys bid for mega power status so that it could sell power to thir d parties dpc sources told business standard several weeks ago that the companys application had been pending with the chief ministers office for months only now has the state government authorised the godbole committee to negotiate with dpc on third party sales outside the state the dpc project is facing the threat of closure following msebs inability to buy power from it thanks to the boards weak financial position not only can the reliance group sell power to third parties within maharashtra but it can sell power to utilities outside the state the ppa does not expressly bar it from doing so nor does it specify the category of customers to whom power can be sold so in effect this suggests that the group could sell power t o industrial and commercial customers in maharashtra and emerge as a rival t o the msebthe state electricity board derives over per cent of its reven ue from such consumers apart from captive power plants independent power producers in india are allowed to sell power only to state electricity boards they can sell powe r outside the state only if they qualify for mega power project status with its mw capacity the patalganga project is not eligible for such status because mega power rojects are supposed to have a minimum capacity of mw speaking on the sidelines of a press conference last week reliance industries managing director anil ambani told business standard a provisi on in third parties ambani was answering a question on whether the msebs weak financials and inability to offer escrow cover to the project as emphasised in the godbole committee report set up to defuse the dabhol crisis would derail the patalganga project the ppa does not have any express restriction as to third party sale outsid e the state a reliance spokesperson confirmed on friday in a faxed response to questions a senior mseb official explained that the state government cleared private power projects some years ago on the basis of the unrealistically high demand projections contained in a report by a former mseb official subsequently it was realised that the state would be stuck with excess power so the reliance group was permitted to sell power to thi rd parties he said the patalganga project along with the ispat groups mw bhadravati project has been put on hold till the godbole committee submi ts its second report the economic times may no need of patalganga bhadravati power mseb the axe seems to have finally fallen on the muchdelayed reliance industriespromoted patalganga and ispat industries bhadravati power projects in maharashtra as the state electricity board has firmly told the government that there is no need of these projects nor their power the lossmaking board has communicated to the government that mseb had no interest in patalganga and bhadravati as it did not have escrowable capacity and also that industrial demand for power had slowed down tremendously in maharashtra state government sources said here on sunday in last november itself mseb had sent an official intimation to the state government informing its decision in favour of cancellation of the two projects on several grounds including they being unviable and unaffordable sources said reliances project is no different from that of dpcs patalganga is also naphthabased and its ppa is on similar lines after the enron experience mseb cannot even dream of another gasbased power plant in the state a senior mseb official said he said mseb has already asked the state government not to provide escrow to both the m w patalganga and the mw coalbased bhadravati as the us energy major has almost squeezed us of all over finances when contacted mseb chairman vinay bansal said reliance and ispat projects have been put on hold as pe r the godbole committees recommendations but expressed inability to give further details currently bhadravati and patalganga projects have been put on hold as per godbole committee report which was set up to review the dpcmseb ppa and energy scenario in maharashtra can you go ahead with the project without an escrow cover the committee was believed to have asked ispat and reliance representatives to which the reply had been negative sources added sources said as of now both the projects have not been able to achieve financial closure as leading financial institutions were not willing to fund the projects which do not have a guaranteed payment mechanism from mseb which incidentally it has promised to dpc all the three were clear ed as fasttrack projects but other than enron reliance and ispat have bee n caught in a quagmire especially bhadravati which has been hanging afire since last nine years they added moreover the mseb official opined that given the current situation if dpc calls it quits from india bhadravati was a safer bet than reliances patalganga patalgangas power would be mere paise less than that of dpc s that ranges anywhere around approximately rs per unit to as high as r s while bhadravatis cost could be around rs to rs per unit he informed msebs installed capacity ended on march was mw a nd it has generated million units with transmission and distribution losses as high as per cent pti business standard may global bankers ask govt to honour dpc obligations tamal bandyopadhyay surajeet dasgupta santosh tiwary in mumbainewdelhi global arrangers for the dabhol power company have mounted fresh pressure o n the finance ministry to honour the union governments counterguarante e and have also set strict conditions for reconsidering the termination of the power purchase agreement ppa between the dpc and the maharashtra state electricity board mseb in a related development the dpc has sent a not e to all lenders saying they would have to bear the consequences of the tur n of events as they have prevented the dpc from serving the ppa termination notice last month the lenders in their turn sent a statement prepared by the new yorkbased legal firm white case defending their stance saying they a re working in the best interest of the project the lenders are expected to meet in london over the next fortnight to take stock of the situationthe deadline for resolving the issues are drawing to a close as days of the threeweek reprieve have passed at the dpc board meeting in london on may the lenders had managed to stall the issuance of the termination notice and got three weeks time for themselves to convince the centre a s well as the maharashtra government to resolve the impasse on the controversial project in a letter to finance secretary ajit kumar dated april the global arrangers said the government must own up its responsibility and meet its obligations without further delay among the stiff conditions set by the arrangers are the demand that the central government ensure payment of all the pending bills of mseb for december january february and march which remain unpaid without any protest or reservation by may monday any payment previously made under protest should be made free and c lear of such protest or any other reservation and the center should ensure time ly payment of future bills by mseb they said meanwhile sources said that t he finance secretary was expected to meet the international lenders to the dabhol projects in london stand on the issue the lenders list of deman ds also include asking mseb to take steps required under the existing contracts to activate the escrow arrangements put in place at the time of financial close of phase ii of the project by may they have demanded that the union government and the maharashtra government should take all required actions to ensure that no government agency will take any step to impede the operation of phase i or the construction and operation of phase ii without due cause the lenders have also asked them to ensure that the relevant customs authorities permit import of all goods and equipment required for the project by may csfb anz export finance citi bank of america and abn amro are the global arrangers for both phase i as well as phase ii of the project the state bank of india which is also a global arranger for phase ii did not sign the letter ten days have passed since the lenders bought three weeks time from the company delaying its declaration of the termination of the ppa since then nothing has moved at the material level barring msebs payment of the january bill to the tune of rs crore under protest sai d a source among the global arrangers come forward to meet its obligations the lenders are planning to meet around midmay in london and this time they will be left with no choice but to give the goahead to the company to terminate the ppa unless the finance ministry comes forward to settle the issue the source added the lenders are however not ready to take the blame for any delay in the termination of ppa as implied by the company th e white case statement said the lenders are concerned about the fate of th e project and they are exploring all intermediate steps before choosing the last option termination of ppa business standard saturday may ge may pull out as dpc supplier s ravindran in mumbai after usbased bechtel it is now the turn of general electric to review it s participation as equipment supplier to the controversial mw power project in maharashtra being set up by the dabhol power companybechtel is the epc contractor to the project while ge has supplied the equipment primarily turbinesgeneral electric like bechtel also holds per cent i n dabhol power company dpc and both bechtel and general electric are worri ed about future payments from dpc sources familiar with the project said that so far dpc has not defaulted in its payments to general electric what is worrying general electric is the possible scenario after june when about mw power will be commissioned after the second phase trial runs dpc and the maharashtra state electricity board mseb have been locked in a payments dispute for months if mseb continues with its stance dpc in turn may not be able to pay general electric in such a situation ge may walk o ut of the project a final decision will be taken only in june said sources general electric did not respond to a faxed questionnaire sent by business standard senior executives at its public relations agency burson marsteller roger pereira said that only dpc executives were authorised to speak on the issue the dpc spokesman declined to comment on the issue the first phase of the mw has already been commissioned after the seco nd phase of mwis commissioned by december mseb will have to pay dpc a minimum of rs crore per month the escrow account for this was to have been made operational by april mseb has refused to do this earlier dpc had invoked the political force majeure clause in its contract with the board mseb is now arguing that the invocation of this clause has absolved dpc of all its liabilities consequently it will not operationalise the escrow account this casts a further shadow over dpcs ability to pay general electric and bechtel t his is worrying the lenders to the project as well the situation has taken a turn for the worse with dpc practically refusing to renegotiate the contra ct for the second phase with the godbole panel constituted by the

london ::::::>>>>>> pricing credit on thousands of names all our challenge for the next few months is to build an automated system to provide differential pricing on thousands of credits by yearend most of these credits will be illiquid in terms of market price information making the challenge harder and the end result more important in terms of competitive pricing advantage what we need is an overall strategy for how we plan to achieve this from the quantitative perspectivecurrently we have several models for credit pricing either in use or under developmentfmc model default probability approach using bloombergs fair market par yield curves probabilities are generated from the riskylibor then defaultbankruptcy swap prices computed using expectation methodologyfmc model credit spread approach using the fmcs then directly taking the libor credit spread at each tenor adjusting for basis and compounding differencesbond model fmc approach taking the fmcs as benchmark curves the model regresses the input bonds specific to a name on the two best fitting benchmarks the result is a zero yield curve with the same shape as the fmcs but with the level tweaked for the specific issuer prices are then generated using both spread and probability approaches under testingbond model spline approach taking only the bonds specific to an issuer the model fits an exponential cubic spline to the zerocoupon price curve then builds a zero yield curve from this under testingmarket prices for certain liquid names or sectorsratings cds market prices are used then recovery and event discount used to get bankruptcy swap priceskmv using expected default frequencies edfs from the kmv model and database we will build a model to price default swaps making appropriate risk adjustments kmv is being installed now so model will be worked on nexteach of these models returns a price credit default and bankruptcy and the accuracy of the price depends on many factors liquidity and regulatory differences between bond and cds markets recovery assumptions risk premia capital charges etc the aim will be to accurately price as many liquid names as possible based upon these models then use these prices alongside other financial information as the backbone to a full automated pricing system our inputs to the proposed pricing system for a specific name are model and market prices for all issuers alongside namespecific soft data from credit reports and financial statements if the credit is liquid enough a price will be generated from their own information only otherwise the credit will be mapped onto a subset of liquid credits with financial information and historical price movements providing the mapping and weights the model price will then be periodically adjusted to align itself with market or trader prices and this adjustment will feed back into the weighting and mapping composition in loose terms we could think of the system price for an illiquid credit as being a weighted average of liquid market prices bonds equities default swaps where the weightings are calibrated using credit analysis financial ratios etcthe key steps to implementing such a system will beestablishing what exactly we want to predict is it a price a rating a probability or a score we will need a clean market history to calibrate to which we only really have for ratings we will then need to develop a mapping from ratingscore to pricegetting and cleaning the historical financial and credit data required to calibrate the modelbuilding the mechanics of the model ie the calibration methodology neural netsfuzzy logic seem the obvious candidates but which exact methods and software packages to usedetermining an automated methodology for mapping names with limited information into the modelgetting the true market price in order to feed back an error at present such a price exists for very few creditsallocating resources to the development mckinsey claimed such a system would take manmonths to developfurther ideas or comments are requested as we need to develop our strategy asap the model description above is fairly vague as we dont yet have the knowledge needed to fill in the specific details further help will be especially required on this if we are to continue to move at internet speedregardsben 
london ::::::>>>>>> additional resources ben and i have been discussing the possibility of getting more dedicated support from houston on our project we are wondering what the possibility is of having either amitava or vasant come over for weeks to help get things jumpstarted on the the credit scoring and modeling front as well as provide some guidance on the clo part of the business and potentially hiring an additional full time resource if there is any possibility it would be hugely valuable given the long lead times to get someone from the city in and integrated in addition to the significant costlet me know your thoughtsbs

london ::::::>>>>>> new update on ppi model for inflation book final version dear allattached is anjams reasoning and final version of the uk ppi pllu model the uk inflation books main exposure is to two ppi indexes the pllu and the dzcv through year both are ppi output indexes with very comparable baskets the only significant difference between the two is the presence of energy in the pllu the model in use escalates the two indexes by the same factors however with the energy price fluctuations in recent years different models for the two indexes would reflect better the nature of their drivers anjam concentrated on the pllu index first and he will shortly construct one for the dzcv based on the same methodology but without the brent crude curve the new model achieves the two main objectives of the ppi curve it is significantly more robust and stable than the existing one and it is considerably less sensitive to the input coefficients this will result in us having more confidence in our monthly pl as well as less fluctuations best regardsmartina xanjam ahmad to martina angelovalonectectcc subject new update on ppi model for inflation bookdear alli followed up on the suggestions of happening babe at the conference call as follows use less dataunfortunately kicking out only makes the overall equation a lot less robust in fact dramatically so and so eliminates the possibility of using less data the model tested was the rpimonth deviations from longterm average for brent crude the rsquared and fstatistic collapsed by eliminating the first months of data deviations in crude variableshifting the crude explanatory variable backwards and forward by and months did not alter the model goodnessoffit parameters dramatically and so my suggestion is that we stick with the following modelpllut arpit brpit cbrentcrudedeviationst constant testing model with sine waveto gauge the response of the model to wildlyvarying rpi forward curve a sine wave of period years for rpi was input into the ppi model the result was as expected ppi preempts the moves in rpi by about months the magnitude of the oscillations is also reduced this shows that if we had more detail in our rpi forward curve then the ppi model would reflect those peaks and humps adequatelyconclusioni therefore propose that we use the model that incorporates rpi rpit and deviations of brent crude from longterm average the new model is plotted below in burgundy and can be compared to the old ppi which is depicted in blue please note that all this analysis only applies to pllu and that a separate study will be needed for the dzcv ppi indexregardsanjamx forwarded by anjam ahmadlonect on anjam ahmad to martina angelovalonectect harry arorahouectect maureen raymondhouectect zimin luhouectect farouk laljihouectectcc trena mcfarlandlonectect dale surbeylonectect stinson gibnerhouectect vince j kaminskihouectect leandro ibascocorpenronenron subject update on ppi model for inflation bookdear allwe thought it might be useful to incorporate brent crude as an explanatory variable for ppi it was found that deviations of dated brent crude from the longterm average of was the best form of the variable to use for predictions the brent forward curve produced by the global products group is used the three new equations developed werepllut arpit brpitn cdatedbrentcrude constant where n is or reddish curvesrsquared approx fstat approx the chart below shows what our projected pllu curve would be given this equation and also the three best relations from before which were based upon current and future rpipllut arpit brpitn constant where n is or greenish curvesrsquared approx fstat approx comparison of modelsas you can see the two equations differ in the very shortterm and very longterm the inclusion of deviations of brent crude leads to shortterm predictions of to over the next six months the greenish curves predict pllu in the range of to over the next six monthsthe curves are then very similar until when the models including crude breakaway to the upside relative to the falling rpi curve the model based purely on rpi hugs the rpi curve much more closely in the longer term this is only important to the extent that we have large positions beyond which we dontsuggestionwhat could be useful now is a differentlyspecified model designed to forecast only the next months using autoregressive or autoregressive error terms this model would be far more accurate in the nearterm and we could include this information onto the front of this longterm model this may be useful despite the fact that most of our exposure is in future time bucketsbacktestingall the models give similar visual and statistical performance over the data sample used based mainly on s new paradigm economyhopefully we can discuss these and other points later in the teleconference your ideas on this would be appreciatedregardsanjamx

london ::::::>>>>>> kirstees role in london vincethis is precisely the concern i have for kirstee steve tells me that she is very imaginative and eager to try to add value but she has no local supervisor to help push some of her ideas i will give you an update of our discussion later and solicit your suggestionsgrant forwarded by grant massonhouect on am kirstee hewitt amto grant massonhouectectcc subject meeting todayhi grant as anjam has set up a meeting for your time how about we try and talk afterwards originally we said your time but i guess that the mg meeting will take longer than half an hour are you free around your time i think some of the communication problems i originally had with anjam have been resolved although it was a difficult situation to interpret however i would very much like to discuss the situation that i am in concerning my immediate management i have felt that over the last month i have been floundering a little and have not really been able to turn to anyone in london for direction concerning var although as expected steve has been very helpful to give me an idea on how to proceed theoretically i do have many of my own ideas although i think i need to obtain some kind of authority to start any substantial work at the moment i feel like i am doing a lot of small things and am worried that at some stage someone is going to ask the question what exactly does she do over there in research i have talked to rodrigo lamas rac model validation new hire and he has helped me to focus on some points i had already made as a quick summary i have drawn up a memo which outlines some of the points i think need to be addressed as far as the var model is concerned i could do a similar memo for the credit reserve model but to start have focused my comments on market riskit is a bit rough and ready pls excuse any appalling spelling mistakes but i think it will help you to see what i have been thinking about since i have been herei do think that the most important issue is that concerning the origin of the volprice curves and how they are constructed cheerskirstee

personal ::::::>>>>>> aa math majors vincethank you so much for meeting with me friday morning about the research group after leaving your office i remembered an issue i have had with the analyst associate program that might be of interest to youduring a texas am recruiting meeting i learned that we have expanded our list of majors to include computer science i wondered why math majors were not mentioned and was told that there was not a business need for math majors like liberal arts majors they said math majors were only considered on a person by person basis in my opinion math majors have many of the same skills as finance majors and can easily adjust to accounting rotations as well i did last summer and finance majors in the program are forced to every year i think that enron is missing out on many qualified candidates by limiting their recruitment effort at texas am the career center asks companies for a list of majors they are targeting and only allows those majors to sign up for interviews through the career center i sent my resume to enron and asked to be included in the interview process on campus however many other math majors had not heard of enron or the other companies and assumed that there was no place for a math major at a company like enron many math majors want to continue their education become teachers or work for an actuarial firm however many are undecided we are constantly told of the many business possibilities available to math majors by our teachers and staff but many undergraduates are still not sure exactly what math majors can contribute in a business environment by not mentioning math majors to the career center a very simple and inexpensive step enron is losing out on a very talented pool of people while it would be nice to get the math majors that knew about enron already had thoroughly researched all companies and determined that math majors would fit perfectly and went the extra step to send enron their resume outside the career center system there are many qualified students who do not do this and opt for other companies who did mention math majorsi called a manager in the aa program to suggest that we consider at least mentioning math majors to the career centers i realize that it may cost more to actively pursue them talk to teachers and attend math society events however i told her that including them at the career center would be very inexpensive for enron she reiterated that they saw no business need for math majors and that if more upper level people began requesting them it would be considered i searched for mathematics on the enron job website and had a surprising number of results i know that your group could use math majors as well however this still may be too small a number to merit a focus from the aa recruiting department i just wanted to bring it to your attention in case it was something that you felt should be changedthanksheather johnsonx

personal ::::::>>>>>> projected fund giving georgehere is one statistical method linear regression applied to hosannas fund giving the method is deterministic where contributions each sunday are attempted to be explained by significant events on the churchs and members calendars and the method shoudl be considered in contrast to an anecdotal one where each sundays giving might be estimated to be the average giving of the same sunday eg each nd sunday in january in the pastthe following effects are estimated independently by the computer they add and subtract with each other accordingly some sundays can have more than one effect in play most positive for giving an additional for special pastoral appeals of them in the past years positive for giving an additional easter and nearest christmas sunday an additional thanksgiving sunday and a tiny additional each week pure time trend negative for giving for sundays of monday federal holiday weekends and during the summer june aug wave there is an per week wave giving higher one week lower the next etc the computer can explain roughly of the absolute variation in giving the past years using this approach keep in mind much of the information statistically is captured in the pastoral appeals easter and christmas sundays and holiday weekends the rest of the variation cannot be explained by this simple model ie it looks like noisehere are the predictions for fund giving for the upcoming year you can cutandpaste these numbers to any file or spreadsheet you like they may seem boring to you please remember they are the deterministic components of a process that involves a lot of volatility and your churchs actual experience will predictably be volatile these numbers are asif the means of experiences dependent on the standard deviations best wishesclayton vernonmanager research

word files the dissertation hasnt been reviewed by les ortheexternal yet although its been at forc for months i think that theempirical chapter is probably the one which would be of most relevance toboth our companys businesses although i ultimately didnt have the timeto explicitly price the jump riskpremium which i conjectured is possiblyimplicit in the prices of exchangetraded electricity futuresoptions rather i developed an implicit estimation procedure which will enable arough assessment with a little bit of further work but not too much bemade of the price of jump risk in wholesale power marketsin other words i assumed spot jumprisk to be undiversifiable andessentially devoted theoretical chapters to proving that a jumpdiffusion trading model is incompletesynthesisingthe securities markets framework with martingale representation theory note that i did not assume that markets could be dynamically completed withterm structure securities as in the hjm w jumps papers of shirakawa anddas and deriving an explicit riskadjustment process for implementing thepriceof jumprisk using a jumpdiffusion marginal indirect utility of wealthprocess ie a jumpaugmented production economy approach in the spirit ofcir bates ahn thompsonincidentally i would be keen to find out if you or any of your team donemuch work on realasset valuations in a sparkspread optionvaluationframework im about to start a project evaluation of embeddedoptionality and have a dilemna whether i should model the spot or forwardgas power price processes with the former i can model meanreversionand jumps explicitly obviously important for capturing the optionality ofoutofthemoney plant which might otherwise be ignored in apurediffusionframework but am not maximising the informational content of the availablemarket data that is assuming there was a longterm market forward curvefor electricity whereas in the latter the driftless forward suppositionmeans that i have to capture meanreversion via the futures volatilityfunction and jumps are less easy to calibrate any suggestions regardsbernardoriginal messagefrom vincejkaminskienroncom mailtovincejkaminskienroncomsent

rukeyser good evening im louis rukeyser this is wall street week welcome back well folks now you know why they call it black tie much of the world of investors regards as a year of mourning for profits past for bubbles burst for bulls dehorned and for certainties crumbledand lets face it it wasnt always fun as winston churchill put it im always ready to learn although i do not always like to be taught virtually nobody except the nonstop pessimists who are still stone losers over the past decade foresaw the viciousness of this years declines although the year was contradictory even therefor example is this a bear market well yes and noeven from their highest heights in early the dow jones industrial average and the sp have declined far less than the twenty percent that traditionally has defined a bear marketbut for the formerly highflying technology stocks personified by the nasdaq this has not only been a bear but the growly of all timenasdaq which never does things moderately fell nearly percent this year and is off more than percent from its march th high that makes this not only the worst year ever for the yearold nasdaq but the biggest decline for any of the three major indexes since the sp lost percent in during the great depression so devastating was this latest and most severe tech wreck that any attempt to put it in perspective by pointing out say that nasdaq has been the bullish phenomenon of the past decade and that it gained more than percent in alone is likely to seem like irrelevant ancient history to todays bleeding tech investorsare they right is this just a temporary reversal of a fantastically promising uptrend or is it truly the end of a booming era were the downward catalysts of a fierce federal reserve a steeply weakening economy and a nation driven to embarrassing selfdoubt by the election that would not die passing phenomena or auguries of enduring changewell try to get you some meaningful answers tonight in the company of four sharpshooting panelists whose recommendations actually made our viewers significant money in while the markets and most of their competitors faltered well review what really did happen in to the economy and to investors and well see if those four can be at least as helpful to us in the year ahead in which not to put too fine a point on it wall street owes us all a lot but first lets see how the bestperforming got better and the worsthit got hysterical in a characteristically mixed ending to a thoroughly mixedup yearthe dow jones industrial average ended on a stronger note despite a finalday selloff gaining more than points to close the year at making this the dows first losing year since most indexes followed the dows upward lead with the conspicuous exception of you guessed it nasdaq which ended the year at less than half its march peakbut the elves filled with the holiday spirit or something continue to insist that better times lie ahead both for the dow where our haloes go as usual to those who voted neutral three months ago since when the dow is up by just a bit more than one percent and for nasdaq which we now insist they also predict to see if that can improve their worst overall yearly record since they were createdthere were minimal changes in the bond and oil markets and the dollar had a mixed week as the longsuffering euro continued its recent reboundand if your investments this year are giving you palpitations try munching some of those holiday sweets youve been trying to put out of your mind a new report in the american journal of clinical nutrition says that chocolate may protect against heart diseasethe theory is that procyanidin found in the candy helps prevent buildup of blood plateletsbrian rogers whats it going to take to build up investor psychology in wall streetrogers well lou i think what weve seen is a very natural transition this year away from some of the higherflying sectors of and i think investors as we enter the new year will be focused on earnings progression what the fed does with rates and i think an awful lot will be determined at least in the first part of the year on what happens to mutual fund cash flows rukeyser when will we know that a week or two from now or will it take longer rogers i think well see a lot of indications in january i think the fed will meet several weeks into the new year i think well see trends in mutual fund cash flow data evident by the end of january and then we also have the january effect i suppose we can look forward to to see how the first month of the year shakes outrukeyser so basically if things dont look a heck of a lot better by midjanuary thats going to be a bad signrogers you can take the rest of the year off at that point rukeyser thanks for your encouragement barbara marcin what do you think whats it going to take to pep up the investors marcin well i think that we have much more reasonable expectations of profit and growth priced into the market here and i really think that what happened this year was it was really a narrow group of stocks that really led the market down it was the same technology and telecommunication stocks which boomed so much last year and last year you could have a reasonable return which would look very mediocre if you werent invested in those stocks and this year if you have a reasonable return it looks very good because the telecom and technology stocks declined so much so i think its really just been a matter of resetting expectations and i think we can still have a good market here with a broad number of stocks attractively pricedrukeyser so it was a good thing that those jazzedup fly boys came down to earth huh marcin well i think it sets us up for a better year in the stock market certainly yesrukeyser lou holland brian mentioned the fed how important is the fed in all thisholland well i think the fed made a big mistake i mean they raised interest rates you know times in months you know basically the economy inflation was not an issue at the time that they were raising it and now of course they took money out of the system because they put a lot in at the end of for yk issues and now theyve taken it out so really i think theyve dropped the ball here and i think that theyre going to have to cut rates here over the next month or so rukeyser how much impact will that have wall street expects them to do that doesnt it holland well i think it does wall street expects that but i think again to see it is to believe it and i think to the extent that greenspan has sort of been a follower he has not been a leader so i suspect that any positive action here will be received relatively positivelyrukeyser you mean the markets have led him holland thats exactly right rukeyser and theyre now leading him to a rate cut holland exactly rukeyser i see well i hope mr greenspan understands that beth dater what do you thinkdater well thats an interesting point because i think typically the stock market is driven by the economy whats sort of interesting about the last yearandahalf is that to some extent the economy has been driven by the stock market and the wealth effect and so i think whats going to be really important to watch here is the consumer and whether the consumer can adjust to a year in the stock market where you may have gains that are more like eight percent than or or high doubledigit gains rukeyser the consumer didnt seem to be too sanguine this christmas dater no the consumer seems to be retrenching definitely somewhat here and i think the question will be back to brians point what will happen when the consumers see their fourth quarter results in some of the mutual fund business its something to watch very closely i thinkrukeyser there was a fall off in the rate of net input into mutual funds last month which is not surprising what do you think why should people turn around and put a lot of money into mutual funds nowdater well i think theres i think that consumers also have to adjust to the fact that you know the same stocks arent going to carry everything that there are areas of diversification such as fixed income and value and other styles of investing where one can still receive good returns over time rukeyser all right now before we look ahead with our winners of the year lets review where weve been in a year most investors would love to forget the dow jones industrial average was the years first victim falling nearly points after peaking in midjanuary at a record but then gained most of it back ending with a loss of just over six percentthe sp peaked later in march but recovered less losing a bit more than ten percent for the yearbut the true carnage was restricted to the nasdaq which was butchered by more than percentin contrast both the new york and american stock exchange composite indexes which track all the common stocks traded there eked out small gains for the year while the smallstock russell was down by just percenteven a bad year for stocks and a hint of inflation couldnt revive the fortunes of the investment worlds longest sufferers the gold bugs whose favorite metal continued to tarnish and silver did even worsethe strong man of the year was the us dollar which easily outperformed all other major currencies with a particularly dazzling gain of percent against the yenmeanwhile the us economy continued as it has now for nearly ten years what has become a record expansion but new doubts about its durability arose as growth slowed in the third quarter to just percent and the fourth quarter seemed even weakerthere was a slight whiff of inflation midway through the year helped along by a stunning rise in oil prices and a period of excess money creation by fed officials who last year took the yk threat too seriously by november there was some relief consumer prices for the past months had increased percent ahead of the pace a year ago but off the summer highscontinuing to defy oldfashioned economic textbooks unemployment remained low even as inflation blipped and the economy chugged forward us unemployment reached a threedecade low at percent and as of the last monthly report in november was still holding at just four percenteven the everedgy bond market stopped trembling about inflation and with the prospect of a softer economy the ghouls rejoiced the yield on the year treasury bond was driven down to percent more than a full point lower than where it was a year agobut shortterm rates which are moreeasily controlled by the federal reserve climbed nearly as much as long rates fell the average yield on taxable moneymarket funds is now up to six percentthe years big international economic story was oil from below a barrel just two years ago oil climbed over this past september before retreating to todays a little more than a dollar higher than a year agofor the fourth year in a row the us trade deficit is setting a record in and next april will mark a full quartercentury since the us last saw even a monthly trade surplusand where do we go from here the conference boards index of socalled leading economic indicators has been anemic throughout with outright negative readings in four of the past five monthsbrian rogers which of these numbers if any is the one to watch in the marketsrogers lou i think the most important thing will be what happens to corporate earnings in the first half things have been sluggish in the second half of this year and i think as we enter the new year corporate profitability will be the most important thing affecting how investors view markets rukeyser and whats your guess on how that will turn out rogers i think well have a decent profit year but when i say decent lou my best guess is in the five to seven percent range and not much more than that from a corporate profitability standpoint rukeyser do you think the markets are expecting that rogers i think the markets are expecting a little bit more than that which makes me think we might continue to have some again some choppiness in the first part of rukeyser barbara marcin what are you going to keep your eye on marcin im going to keep my eye on the consumer confidence levels you know we had three forces which slowed the economy this year the federal reserve raising interest rates high oil and gas prices and really a sharp drop off in consumer confidence as the stock market fell and that slowed spending a lot and i think that if that were to get much worse or consumers really stopped spending that could spiral a little bit more into companies incorporating that and having layoffs and really then we could get a recession so thats what im keeping my eye onrukeyser consumers have been the heroes and heroines of this whole expansion marcin yesrukeyser there are some signs theyre flagging a little but you want to see how much marcin yes rukeyser whats your guess marcin i think that right now im not predicting a recession so im not predicting that theyre going to flag that much more we just had this week the third straight month of a fall off in consumer confidence and i think that perhaps come the new year we can regain it but that is what im concerned about rukeyser lou holland how about you holland i agree with barbara i think the consumer sentiment has deteriorated and i think that theres probably a greater than chance that were probably going to have a recession its sort of the old notion of the federal reserve pushing on the string in order to get the economy going by reducing rates or injecting money into the system and im not so sure that the system will swallow it quick enough to stop us from falling into recessionrukeyser so you think the fed has waited far too long holland i think so rukeyser do you think theres a chance that theyll cut more than a quarter percent next month holland i think its possible that they could have an interim meeting to cut and i think its very possible they could cut a half a point rukeyser beth can you cheer me up any more dater well i think it gets down to interest rates because i think that is what will ultimately influence the consumer confidence im a little bit concerned about the dollar in here i mean i think that we have had a huge amount of foreign investment also into our capital markets here and if the dollar were to weaken substantially that might be at risk and we might see some repatriation of some of those foreign investments rukeyser all right now comes the moment of truth when we turn the spotlight on what these folks said twelve months agoin what has been for decades the toughest competition in investing the lists cannot be changed for any reason during the ensuing twelve months it was a tough year even for our certified geniuses though the average of all our panelists continued to beat the performance of the sp let alone the sagging nasdaq you can check all their records on our web site it will be up after midnight tonight as youll see the five who actually defied the odds and made you money in included the four stalwarts here tonightbrian rogers to show what a weird year it was you were the secondclosest of all our panelists behind marty zweig in predicting the dows high and close though even you were too optimistic by nearly and points respectively that was good this yearbut in the farmoreimportant actual moneymaking part of the competition you excelled with a portfolio of specific recommendations that according to calculations by our friends at bloomberg financial markets was up a whopping percent aided by three timely short sales and a neardouble in bergen brunswig congratulationsrogers thank you rukeyser barbara marcin with both you and brian here its clearly the value players night out while your prediction that the dow would get above turned out to be ridiculously high you came within points points of nailing the precise dow low of and better still your portfolio is up more than percent in this generallygrim year thanks to the best single pick of any panelist everest reinsurance holdings which rewarded you with a percent gain so thanks barbara for bringing us so much value marcin thank you rukeyser lou holland welcome back to your fourth yearend appearance the most of any panelist here tonight and you earned it while your high low and close were way off the mark a familiar song this year your portfolio was up more than percent powered by the morethandoubling of washington mutual way to go lou holland thank you rukeyser beth dater this is your third yearend program and your cautious approach to investing in including putting percent of the portfolio in threeyear treasury notes paid off with an average gain of more than percent in that looked awful good so congratulations bethdater thank you lou rukeyser but enough with the compliments however wellearned in a year like this past one theres a new and we hope different year ahead and what have you done for us lately for starters in our annual triumph of hope over experience lets hear from each of you the true inside word on the highest close the lowest close and the final close for both the dow jones industrial average and nasdaq in and this time gang lets all get it exactly right brianrogers lou for the dow i have a high of a low of and a close of and for the nasdaq a high of a low of and a close of rukeyser barbara marcin for the dow i have a high of a low of and a close of and for nasdaq a high of a low of and a close of rukeyser lou holland for the dow i have a high of a low of and a close of for the nasdaq i have a high of a low of and a close of rukeyser bethdater lou for the dow i have a high of a low of and a close of and for the nasdaq a high of a low of and a close of rukeyser okay well one thing is for sure and this is my only personal unqualified guarantee of the night at least some of them will be wrongbut if youd like to see the full predictions with specific stock selections from all of our panelists all those lists will be included in tonights transcript which you can get for by writing to yearend transcripts wall treet week with louis rukeyser

semiconductor disney exodus communications fortune brands hasbro morgan stanley emerging markets fund motorola octel ryder system sprint fon group and unisource energyrukeyser barbara marcin im keeping the two from this years list that did not perform and thats cendant and mattel and im adding compaq worldcom lucent loral space communications att wireless and motorola rukeyser a little tech in there hmm marcin yes rukeyser techs going to have a little comeback you think marcin thats right tech and telecom mayberukeyser some of those bleeding people will be very happy to hear that from a cautious person like yourself lou holland okay i have carnival corp cec entertainment ceridian corp clorox company chase manhattan bank cognos inc intel one of your favorites louis home depot jabil circuit microsoft and worldcom rukeyser my favorites are the ones that go up the ones i hate are the ones that go down you know what will rogers said theres nothing hard about the stock market you buy a stock and when it goes up you sell it if they dont go up you dont buy beth dater your list dater lou weighting in year us treasury notes the balance equally weighted in amgen berkshire hathaway cisco systems intel medimmune mellon bank morgan stanley dean witter royal dutch petroleum schlumberger walmart and westwood onerukeyser hearing as much financial services as i do is that an interest rate forecast as welldater its an interest rate forecast and also its a call on valuations which i think are still very interesting in that area rukeyser how about some of those fallen giants that youve picked that suggests to me that you dont think its the end of the world dater i do not think its the end of the world and i do think its a time of some uncertainty and its a time to think of preservation of capital first and foremost and therefore im going with some household names at this point rukeyser especially some that have been knocked so far down that dater exactly the valuations are coming into reasonable levelsrukeyser brian rogers lets hear from you on interest rates what do you think rogers lou i think well see a normalization of the yield curve this year so i think well see short rates fall the fed will cut rates probably a couple of times and i think the big gain this year was in the long bond in calendar year i think that game is probably mostly over would be my best guess rukeyser and shortterm rates you dont think are going to fall that much rogers no i think shortterm rates will fall causing the yield curve to lookrukeyser but how much do you think theyll fall rogers i think theyll fall at least or basis points this year rukeyser okay if we can get that over the next two weeks that might help some of your inflows into your mutual fundsrogers well well be happy then rukeyser thank you all very much there we do have to stop i hope youll join me next week twice first for our regular program when my guest will be the incomparable abby joseph cohen and

universities ::::::>>>>>> re corn subsidy govt program analysis vasantthanks lets contact wharton next weekvincefrom vasant shanbhogueenronenronxgate on amto vince j kaminskihouectectcc nelson nealenaenronenron subject corn subsidy govt program analysishi vince nelson and i had a meeting yesterday with the ag desk folks on how to go forward on the analysis and presentation for this program the consensus from the ag side was that the choice of university will be highly politically driven ie preferably the university should be from a state that has close ties to sympathetic senators or other political figures also it is preferable if the university faculty have worked on ag issues before lending more credibility in the ag community the names that came up were mississippi state and texas am nelson knows of a person at mississippi state who worked with the usda on risk management issues the needed analysis itself is not necessarily very deep and the focus is primarily to get a nonquantitative presentation out that outlines how enron can take on the downside risk of local crop prices enron probably needs to cover actual local prices and not simply an index because i do not think the govt will want to worry about basis risk the pilot program itself will be very small and lends itself to continuing down the path of short term trading rather than long term origination another thought on hedging our potential short positon on the origination side is that the govt program can only provide a partial hedge to the extent of the premium received we still have unlimited downside from the shortvasantps i am writing up jim bouillions project suggestion as a potential project for wharton of course we may still ask wharton for their insights on the corn price protection approach

universities ::::::>>>>>> re fw pserc nuggets related to market stem hi vince and happy new yeargood to hear from you and i can understand being busy i am myself trying tobalance my commitments herelike any research consortium pserc is trying to provide value to its memberswhile walking the fine line between cooperation and competition we aredefinitely not in the business of providing proprietary research to themembers but rather working on more generic areas that later individualmembers could see way to convert to proprietary tools the work that shijiedeng and rajnish kamat have been doing with me are good examplesas to my trip thanks for the invitation but i already committed myself toget back friday night so i will save my visit for another timei will tell my son about the spring interviews at cornell hopefully thistime he will not miss itregards shmuel original message from vincejkaminskienroncomto orenqueueieorberkeleyeducc vincejkaminskienroncomsent monday january pmsubject re fw pserc nuggets related to market stem hello shmuel thanks for your message the end of and the beginning of were extremely busy and i could not focus on pserc issues i shall consult a few people in enron on this subject and get in touch with you our concern right now is that the results of research are widely shared with our competition i am out on the th but the th would work for me i would be glad to cover the cost of your austin to houston trip regarding your son the analyst associate program will interview againon the campus in the spring and they will be more than happy to

vince happy holidays i wanted to connect with you regarding the possibility of enron joining pserc as you might have heard from lance and alex we are going through a transition period having doubled the number of universities and industry members within the last year consequently our business processes are not well developed one of the problems we are facing is the balance between the electrical engineering folks and industry members that are more interested in market related research i hope to recruit more of the later so tat we have more of a constituency in the advisory board that sees the value of market related research i already have a verbal commitment from people at electrabell that expressed interest in joining pserc with members like electrabell and enron we will be able to support more market stem projects such as the one that shijie deng proposed not funded in this round please let me know if i can do anything to facilitate the decision at enron i am going to be in austin on january to participate at a puct hearing and could come through huston for a visit attached are some items that i shared with our pserc members and thought that you might be interested in them as well regards shmuel original message from shmuel oren orenieorberkeleyedu to power systems engineering research center pserclcornelledu sent tuesday december am subject re pserc nuggets related to market stem the following are items that demonstrate the impact of pserc research in the market stem area on december i shmuel oren testified at a hearing in san francisco before the blue ribbon panel chaired by alfred kahn for the that is investigating the implications of uniform price vs pay as bid auctions in the california px as part of my testimony i presented a movie produced by tim mount and bob thomas that show results of an experimental economic study showing how bidders respond by raising their bids in a pay as bid auction following is an acknowledgement i received dear shmuel thank you for attending the blue ribbon panel this past tuesday in san francisco your presentation was very informative and valuable to all the panel members and other participants the panel greatly appreciatesyour involvement in this important project thanks again natalie efland a recent email from the texas puc professor oren i hope you and your family are doing well we are seriously considering your help and advice to facilitate the commissions final decision regarding retail competition in ercot i wanted to let you know that ercot stakeholders filled an application for approval of the ercot protocols in november we received comments including list of issues on november and reply comments on december staff will draft and submit a preliminary order to the commissioners for their discussion on december there will be a prehearing on december when parties will be asked to brief the commission on list of issues by the end of first week in january there will be a hearing on january followed with another hearing if needed parties have asked the commission to finalize its decision by mid march to give you some more background i have to mention that almost most of your suggestions were accepted and will be reflected in the final protocols except for problems with intrazonal gaming regarding congestion management and payasbid compensation for selected ancillary services a few additional concerns are raised regarding ancillary services and congestion management stakeholders are still working toward more load participation in ercot market however the main problem is the fact that market pilot that covers of wholesale but only of retail load will be open on june based on a version of the protocols locked on august that was the deadline for ercot to give a final design to anderson consulting that version does not include some of your recommendations to address market design flaws the full version is highly possible to be implemented by january when market for retail competitionis scheduled to open given this gap some parties have recommended not to implement incomplete protocols and wait for full implementation by january in other words they say lets go ahead with pilot retailload but wait for full design implementation before allowing wholesale load and retail load be subject to the rules of the game described in the final protocols thanks parviz adib ph d director of market oversight division public utility commission of texas n congress avenue po box austin texas ph no the following is a segment from a published summary of the dec puct hearing this segment describes the commisions deliberation on anagenda item addressing the possibility of instituting price caps as part of the ercot protocols see reference to my involvement in the next to last paragraph docket no petition of the electric reliability council of texas for approval of the ercot protocols discussion and possible action parviz adib jess totten keith rogas and tammy cooper chairman wood turned to page item number of the draft order identifying issues recommending that the word including be changed to otherthan in the parentheses he thinks they know the ups and downs of the two mechanisms which are bid caps and price caps but would not mind having parties focus on what other protections might be used commissioner walsh would say including but not limited to because she does not think it is a bad idea for ercot to at least consider in their protocols a failsafe mechanism its kind of like the stock market suspending trading when something crazy happens they could consider a maximum scenario suchas we dont think this will ever happen but if it does we need to muffle it whether it is or or whatever it is they could consider whether to put into the protocols a selfenacting price cap while notexpecting it to happen if it did you dont have to declare it an emergency and have the commission have to act chairman wood asked if they could leave the question without the parenthetical at all and just say what protections should be added to avoid extreme price spikes commissioner walsh reiterated that she wants ercot to think about the unlikely possibility of unacceptable price spikes she would like for them to have their own failsafe mechanism that is selfinitiating as opposed to leaving thatto having someone have to come in and act commissioner perlman statedthat he thinks the californiatype price caps is what the concern is about he thinks everyone in this state is opposed to those but he thinks the point commissioner walsh is making is an interesting one he had not thought about the circuit breaker idea and it might have some merit he agreed that it was worth considering something like that then the question becomes what the level is chairman wood suggested the wording what selfimplementing protections should be added to avoid the price spikes commissioner perlman said he did not think anyone is talking about price caps commissioner walsh agreed but noted that if the unexpected happens we should be prepared commissioner perlman indicated that if someone is making in one particular hour that it probably does not b enefit the market and is probably a windfall to them it is not something they would normally put in their business plan for determining whether they are going to build a plant in texas chairman wood stated that theywant to lean toward the market as heavily as they can on these issues chairman wood noted that some of these issues date back to when dr oren was assisting the commission and asked if he could be brought back again staffer dr parviz adib said that staff had already talked to dr oren and that he is available to assist the commission further chairman wood noted that dr oren had helped people think outside the box without just focusing on california the final wording was clarified to state selfimplementing mechanisms and to delete the parenthetical part of the sentence in question the order was approved as amended

universities ::::::>>>>>> wharton collaborative research here is a short note on potential research with wharton please review and edit and then we can send some indication to the wharton guys the objective would be to define the amount of risk an enterprise can take and the difference between this and the actual amount of risk the enterprise chooses to take based on the capital structure and reporting structure in particular one can view enron as a hierarchy of companies and assuming we can separately quantify the risks of each unit what framework would one use to analyze risk at enron a related question is how one should represent risks in the different units risks may be of different types shortterm volatility risk catastrophic risk liquidity risk etc what should one focus on for a first cut another related question is to decide on the optimal amount of insurance both at the unit level and the enterprise level and relate the decision to get insurance to the costbenefit of insurance

universities ::::::>>>>>> energy finance critiques david here are the reviews of the ut energy finance program that you requested from jennifer martinez mba class of energy finance taken fall of the energy finance program years ago was very good especially considerin g it was the first year of the program there were a lot of guest speakers from various energy companies who gave us a lot of practical knowledge abou t the energy industry through case studies lectures etc basically we learned all the same finance concepts and tools as in the regular finance classes but all the cases and examples were energyrelated the professor s were good for the most part but didnt have a great deal of practical industry experience if i had to guess the reason for decreased participation in the program i would probably say it is the professors ronn and titman are great but known as being very technical and quantitative some students prefer less technical professors and classes that arent limiting to the energy industry also the fact that the class meets for hours twice a week may not be so appealing other than those things i cant imagine why there has been such a drop in enrollment i especially dont understand why every single person didnt drop for enron i wonder if it has something to do with international status from john massey mba class of energy finance taken fall of bottom line ut business schools is great investment fund best activity available to students energy finance program fairly weak it was a watered down version of the futures options class crossed with a weak finance appendage the finance teacher was pathetic both a poor teacher ignorant about industry specific analysis devoid of industry experience rude to outside lectures from industry keith brown was the only educator that was any good and he only had a small portion of the class time way to make better get teachers with practical industry experience make it a seminar class focus on case studies lectures given by people from industry promote the class within the business school i felt like ut did a poor jo b of internally to students promoting the class from ross mesquita mba class of energy finance taken fall of to be honest a great majority of the coursework was not energy specific when energy applications were presented it seemed more like general financ e questions were reworded to include energy lingo we had some very good speakers but for the most part i did not feel like the hours of class h ad enough energy focus i assumed that this would get better as the program progressed one reason that may account for the decline in enrollment is that energy finance is a very specific focus i would have probably not enrolled in th e energy finance program had it been available in my first year i did not know enough about energy at that time and i had returned to bschool to consider several career options ie investment banking corporate finance entrepreneurship marketing etc as a new mba student i would n ot want to narrow my window of opportunities to only energy companies here is my perspective and probably something that is true of many mbas my interest in enron brought me to the energy industry and not vice versa from billy braddock mba class of energy finance taken fall of i was a participant in the inaugural energy finance program in the fall of the primary positives to the class revolved around outside panelsinstruction for example enron sent representatives on separate occasions to discuss particular topics vince kaminski and gary hickerson other notable speakers were jeff sandefer independent business consultant and ep professional the beacon group and encap investments another go od speaker was a professor from uts school of engineering he brought a good perspective as to the basics of the energy business the class was structured via a teambased instruction approach with professors teamteaching a hour credit course none of the professors had any product knowledge of the energy business of the professors were research focussedtenured with little credibility in teaching one of the professors primary focus of research was fixed income while the other were investments and corporate finance respectively as is the case for uts finance program in general and energy finance in particular ut is in dire need of teaching professors as opposed to resear ch professors that have the ability to convey finance with practical examples and at a level that can be more easily be understood by students without a finance background particular to the energy program ut needs to have mor e instruction from energy professionals such as the instructors used for enrons internal learning programs ie derivatives classes etc from bryan williams mba class of energy finance taken fall of i participated in the first energy finance class offered in fall of a t the university of texas the curriculum was understandably rough around the edges as wa s the first year the energy finance course was offered however the instruction also suffered as none of the instructors had any energy background to speak of the credit hour class was team taught by three tenured professors two of the three professors have coauthored textbooks and the third professors claim to fame is fixed income as a group the three profes sors are researchheavy as opposed to industry focused and the teamteaching format did not incent any one of the profs to be personably accountable for the success of the class that said the instructors did a good job attracting some top notch outside speakers among them vince kaminski gary hickerson both of enron they also dedicated one class period to a video conference call with the beacon group an energy consulti ng group that i believe was recently acquired by goldman jeff sandefer an independent businessman an entreprenuership instructor and one of the foremost experts in the ep sector also spoke to the class jeff was joined by some of the executives from houstonbased encap the woes of the energy finance could be easily remedied by injecting some instruction from someone from industry the class is too academictheoretical with too few relevant examples excerpted from the ener gy sector the instructors enron uses for the derivatives courses taught internally ar e good examples of people who can package very relevant information and successfully articulate it in a couple of days perhaps a similar approach would bode well for the energy finance program at ut from yuan tian mba class of energy finance taken fall of here are my thoughts on the ut energy finance program pros more focused on the finance studies in the energy industry which is right now in a transition period from regulation to deregulation and thus is exposed to different financial perspectives from the other industries there are some experienced brandname professors eg sheridan titman teaching in the program cons the program should give the students more exposures to energy companies such as enron specifically it might need to help students link to the interview oppurtunites from these energy companies such as enron from george huan mba class of energy finance taken fall of companies expect mba students to have both general management new ideas a nd analytic quantative skills energy industry is no exception energy finance program offers financial strategy and risk managements cours es which fit in the insudtry need however these two courses are far from enough to help students understand the dynemic of industrial transformation and excitements and opportunities in this industry other management and quantitive courses are needed to complete this program my suggestions seminars or lectures about energy industry and energy companies before students make their decisions let them know whats happening and whats going to happen in this industry what the companies are doing now who they are looking for management andor analytical courses should be included such as strategy financial enginering and real option more industry connections presentations and discussions from charlie weldon mba class of energy finance taken in fall of my experience in the energy finance program overall was a positive experience the most rewarding part of the class was the guest speakers brought in during dr titmans portion of the class this part of the cour se is taught in the second half of the semester and consisted of case classes all focusing on the energy industry two of the cases were based o n enron and overall the case selection in my opinion was very appropriate an d well thought out value added by the professor was less than from the speakers and cases the first eight weeks of the course covered futures and options nearly a ll of the examples and problems discussed pertained directly to the energy industry and special emphasis was placed on increasing the students understanding of the supply and demand dynamics in the power market the u se of options and futures for speculating andor hedging was stressed on numerous occasions and a decent attempt at explaining how to value a power plant project i believe that the university energy finance faculty are trying to continuously make improvements to the program however i do not believe that they are moving fast enough or necessarily down the right path to improvement there is a strong need for more practical based training on energy derivatives similar to the course taught by paradigm here at enron the focus of the university teachers is quite theoretical due in large par t to their background while the theoretical basis is crucial to understandi ng the basics the real value of such a program in my opinion is the effective bridging of the theoretical with the practical all in one course until measures are taken to inject practicality from someone with extensive industry experience i believe the energy finance program will continue to underdeliver on its objectives additionally i believe that the course structure should be changed to eliminate the need of having consecutive hours of classroom instruction

ut ::::::>>>>>> comments hi sheridanhow are you i hope that you had a good vacation vasant and i looked at your memo and found it to be interesting i shall first briefly summarize our understanding of the methodology you propose the comments follow finally i shall sketch a simple gas field project you can use as a test case in further refining the modelit appears that you are proposing a statespace approach where probabilities of different states at various future dates are specified the next step is to assume a discount rate and to compute the present value by following the branches from the origin to one of the terminal points traversing through the tree in this manner over many iterations will permit us to compute the average present value of the project also you are using the simulation to assign a value of the project to each node thus each node will have a cash flow associated with it which will occur if the node is reached and a value which is an expectation of the value to be realized going forward if some of these values turn out to be negative zerocoupon riskfree bonds are purchased to neutralize the negative realization next we find a comparable and apply the expected rate of return back to our project based on the variance of the returns we iterate until convergencefinally we subtract the initial investment and the computed risk capital from the pv of the gross cash flows including debt to determine if the project merits further considerationcommentsclarifications the money is being set aside to avoid negative values it is not clear if you mean the values of the cash flow or the pv at the node anyhow we shall be setting aside money not just for that specific node but all nodes at that crosssection of time as the riskfree asset pays in all states of nature this will have to be done every time there is a negative realization thus for the typical project we have the value of risk capital may be extremely high as we are not following a tailbased norm anymore your memo appears to suggest that debt capacity is contingent on all values being positive if so we are only issuing riskfree debt also a project with a single negative value at each crosssection of time will not have a positive debt capacity it seems that our optimization argument is the discount rate which is obtained in each step from the comparison investment by equating the variances it is not clear if changing the discount rate will have such an effect on the project variance so as to lead to a global convergence also our project has a finite life and the marketbased assets will have infinite lives in the light of this fact how will we define the relevant variance is it the spot variance of the returns of the comparison investment finally our criterion is to subtract from the average pv the investment and also the risk capital setting risk capital to zero this model closely resembles the intuitive present value criterion and endogenously determines the discount rate gas field caseto facilitate your thinking we are providing a gas field example belowwe invest x million dollars to buy and develop a gas field a profile of expected production and variance of the production per year is available from the engineers at the beginning production will be autocorrelated as the profile will shift up or down based on the actual gas reserves being more or less than the estimated reserves we assume the life of the field to be years with no salvage value there are fixed and variable operating costs it might be useful for you to think about applying the framework to this problemdo let me know if you have further questionsrakesh

ut ::::::>>>>>> re comments fyi forwarded by rakesh bharatinaenron on pm sheridan titman titmanmailutexasedu on pmto rakeshbharatienroncomcc subject re commentsrakeshthanks for your input they are quite useful for helping me clarify my ownthinking the following are my responses to your comments andclarifications the ed paragraphs are from me and the others are from you the money is being set aside to avoid negative values it is not clearif you mean the values of the cash flow or the pv at the node anyhow weshall be setting aside money not just for that specific node but all nodesat that crosssection of time as the riskfree asset pays in all states ofnature this will have to be done every time there is a negativerealization thus for the typical project we have the value of riskcapital may be extremely high as we are not following a tailbased normanymore i agree that this is confusing and needs further refinement i do thisbecause i have some concerns about discounting negative cash flows thisis discussed in my first memo this clearly provides a conservativeestimate of firm value and a measure of risk capital that is too highfrom the perspective of evaluating the appropriate level of risk capitalit is sufficient that enough capital be employed so that the pv at eachnode is positive also one might want to set the level so that the pv ispositive in say of all nodes your memo appears to suggest that debt capacity is contingent on allvalues being positive if so we are only issuing riskfree debt also aproject with a single negative value at each crosssection of time will nothave a positive debt capacityagain this is a very conservative initial estimate when the model isrefined you probably want to define debt capacity so that the projectdefaults a certain percent of the time it seems that our optimization argument is the discount rate which isobtained in each step from the comparison investment by equating thevariances it is not clear if changing the discount rate will have suchan effect on the project variance so as to lead to a global convergencei am not assuming that the change in the discount rate has a major effecton volatility in fact i think the process requires only one iterationwhen the volatility is independent of the discount rate again the ideais that we calculate the volatility of the projects value calculated withan initial discount rate using the calculated volatility and the stock ofa comparison firm calculate a more appropriate discount rate if thevolatility of the projects value is not affected by the change in discountrates then we are done if however the change in discount rates changesvolatility then we may have to iteratelet me know if this makes sensealso our project has a finite life and the marketbased assets will haveinfinite lives in the light of this fact how will we define the relevantvariance is it the spot variance of the returns of the comparisoninvestmentthis is a good point i was thinking in terms of the average variancebut this may not be correct actually we know that this is just anapproximation and we need to think about whether or not it is a goodapproximation typically firms tend to ignore issues relating to theduration of their project cash flows when they determine discount ratewhich clearly does not make sense this requires some additional thought finally our criterion is to subtract from the average pv theinvestment and also the risk capital setting risk capital to zero thismodel closely resembles the intuitive present value criterion andendogenously determines the discount ratethis is correct my goal was to come up with something that was closelyrelated to what you are already doing but which gives you some insight intohow to define risk capital and the appropriate discount rate there are anumber of ways that we can refine and improve this procedure what we needto first consider is whether or not the basic approach makes sense for thekind of projects that you are evaluatinggas field caseto facilitate your thinking we are providing a gas field example belowwe invest x million dollars to buy and develop a gas field a profile ofexpected production and variance of the production per year is availablefrom the engineers at the beginning production will be autocorrelated asthe profile will shift up or down based on the actual gas reserves beingmore or less than the estimated reserves we assume the life of the fieldto be years with no salvage value there are fixed and variableoperating costs it might be useful for you to think about applying theframework to this problemthis problem is probably pretty straightforward because it is unlikelythat the cash flows will be negative once the gas field is producinghence there is no need to be concerned about risk capital other than thex million dollars to buy and develop the property to value the propertyassuming allequity financing we calculate the value process of thedeveloped project and compare its volatility to a comparison investmentwhose value process is observable eg a traded mlp the riskadjustedreturn of the comparison investment would then be used to discount the cashflows of the gas fieldplease note that this procedure requires relatively strong assumptions andcalculating the riskadjusted return on the comparison investment is notnecessarily straightforward let me know when you would like to discuss thison another topic is it possible for you to give me information about onecase where enron bought or sold a base load power plant where thepurchaser financed the transaction with nonrecourse debt we would likethe following information the value of the power plant or purchase price the amount of debt financing and the terms of the debt contract some information about the pricing of gaspower swaps and optionsabout a year ago i gave vince a paper which develops a pricing model forproject debt i dont think he thought that it could be implemented on thetype of projects that enron finances however my coauthors would like totry applying the model for one case studylet me know when you want to discuss these issuesthankssheridansheridan titmandepartment of

class for about an hour one thursday afternoon to discuss your viewsregarding applications of option pricing concepts to real options as areminder ive attached a course outline chris kenyon from schlumberger isspeaking on april and vince kaminski has tentatively agreed to speak onapril i am going to be out of town on april so that leaves either nextthursday april or may would either of those times work for you imnot thinking of any preparation but more of an informal discussion of thephilosophical issues related to real options work jimoriginal messagefrom jim dyersent thursday march pmto jclevengeroptioniibusutexasedusubject re real options course feedbackjosh some very thoughtful observations as you know i had invited onefinance professor to our class on arundel but he was out of town i doplan to invite sheridan titman to discuss the issue of using the optionmodels in situations where there is no underlying security that is tradedi do think it is important to face that issue which is actually covered ata theoretical level in our last couple of readings the issue of volatility is also an excellent issue for furtherdiscussion as you suggest so far weve been looking at cases wherevolatility is given the problem of finding an objective measure ofvolatility for a project reminds me of the problem of finding the correctrisk adjusted discount rate which is not surprising since the concepts arealmost two sides of the same plate one approach of course is to do somemodeling using traditional decision analysis tools including subjectiveprobabilities but the finance people who write options articles dont liketo think about such ideas ill try to address these issues in more detail as the semestercontinues i think it was important to surface some of these points earlyand to come back to them after we have seen how to apply the methods in anaive sort of way thanks for the feedback and comments jimoriginal messagefrom

initial i hope overload of materials and toolspresentedthus far in the semester it appears to me that you are achieving theobjectiveof making us comfortable with optionality valuation as applied to a varietyofproblems which are outside the borders defined by a liquid market of tradedfinancial elementsas a constructive feedback you have been forthright with us in marking offareas of this subject which are still controversial i also realize thatrightly so realworld application of this type of analysis without a robustunderstanding of finance may degenerate into a succession of assumptionsthatresult in a house of cards effect my opinion at this point is that twoissues are of potentially makeorbrake importance if i am to persuade mysuperiors to accept these methods for valuations outside the realm ofprojectswhose value is primarily driven by the value of commodities backed byfinancialinstruments these issues are easy to guess discounting and risk free rates i do not sense that anyone in theclasshas put forth convincing arguments as to the proper application of timevaluequestions in the absence of liquidity is there someone within the financedepartment that can present a firmer position on this question volatility i found winstons examples on this metric succinct i wouldrecommend that in future years you dedicate some hours of class time to thissubject my criticism again relates to messy problems i anticipateargumentsagainst real option applications based on the dispute of volatilitymeasuresif i were a conservative financial manager i would argue that

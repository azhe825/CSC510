bankruptcy ::::::>>>>>> northern natural gas yesterday enron settled a procedural dispute with dynegy over northern natural gas our settlement allows dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline dismisses their texas lawsuit and extends enrons right to repurchase until june we reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring enron out of bankruptcy while we would like to keep northern natural we still have some miles of safe profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses the settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our billion damage claim against dynegy it also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts we want to see a positive future for the employees working with northern natural gas below is a copy of a message from stan horton further explaining this decision to the employees of enron transportation serviceskendear ets colleagueon thursday enron entered into a settlement over dynegys exercise of its option to acquire the northern natural gas pipeline the settlement allows dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while enron pursues its damage claim against dynegy in this respect enron corp has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of northern natural gas consequently enron corp has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of northern natural gas to dynegy while the larger issues affecting its future are resolvedthe company has concluded that with this settlement enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court for the northern natural gas employees i believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the daytoday satisfaction of running a valuable successful businessbeginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe reliable and efficient operation of northern natural gas over many years we have run high quality cost conscious and profitable businesses in ets keep up the good workstan

bridgeline pipeline systemssummary the lrc bridgeline pipeline systems will be combined under the name of bridgeline llc ownership in the jv will be split texaco enron bridgeline gas marketing llc will be the entity that will be trading on the pipelines under the new jv contracts and service agreements are in the process of being drafted enron will be providing the trading and commercial operations systems to support this jv texaco will be providing the scada system i understand that accounting is still being discussed the trading risk perhaps scheduling personnel for this jv will be initially relocated to the st floor of the enron building and will eventually move to probably the allen center once a more permanent spot can be built out trading for the new jv will start in early february for march productionto dosaccounting ive asked jim coffey to set up two work orders to capture it transition and ongoing costs texaco is also trying to set up a meeting next monday to step through the accounting flow so that we are all on the same page and make sure there is nothing that will fall through the crackspcs jim fussell is in the process of ordering the pcs for this jv at my request i will need the work order numbers to track these costsnetworks im coordinating with arshak and his team to make sure that the voice and data networks are in place for eb once the more permanent spot is nailed down we will then need to do the same for that location a combination of trader phones lucent phones stenfons and amtels have been requestedlocation on eb im waiting on a call back from chris larson from facilities to find out what locations on will be assigned to the new jv currently half of the floor is empty but they are set up with high wall cubes there may need to be some build out for the traders to low wall cubes we cant set up the pcs phones amtels etc until this is donedata conversion i have requested from texaco the contract deal and meterfacility information we will need to set up in our systems to begin trading for march production it may be possible to get an electronic dump of this data from texaco if enron defines the data fields that we will need we also need to set up the trading entities and portfolios i will also need to know who will need to have access to this data so that we can set up the system security i have received the names of the traders but i dont know who else will need accessinterface between enrons unify pops application and bridgelines scada application ive asked dave nommensen from enron to get with carryn wright from texaco to begin the process of defining the interface between the two applications and estimate the time to build and implement the interface there will also need to be a transition plan put in place where lrcs rtusefm is redirected to the bridgeline scada system in the meantime there will be two scada systems and perhaps two gas controls until everything is merged into one this will probably mean some manual interfaces between pops and scada for confirmed noms and efm volumes until the transition is completescada communications currently the lrc rtusefm communicate back to enrons scada system via leased lines bridgelines rtus communicate back to them via a microwave system the new jv could save on communications costs by switching lrcs rtu communication to the microwave perhaps this is best done as a part of the scada transitionaccounting data needed by texaco for royalty purposes this data needs to be better defined i will follow up with john ledoux from texaco to get this process startedhourly volumes bridgeline currently has one utility customer who may be billed on an hourly basis depending on the amount of swing we need to talk through this process to see what enhancements may be needed at least initially there will need to be some manual processes in place to support the billing for this one customerplease let me know if youd like to meet on any of these topics i can have my assistant set up the meeting if needed in the mean time i can be reached at thanks tommy

enron_news ::::::>>>>>> california energy crisis californias power crisis has generated heated debate over the last seve ral months unfortunately this debate has generated more heat than light we want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on california energy issues what happened in california the source of californias current problem is as straightforward as supp ly and demand californias economy grew percent since this incr eased the demand for electricity by percent at the same time regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state so demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added the resul t predictably is a shortage this summer peak capacity will be about percent shy of peak demand leading to further blackouts in the state in addition to the supply and demand imbalance there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis first the states regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market the spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile the way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo ng term medium term and short term to reduce exposure to this volatility i n california state regulation prevented this strategy this would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th e most volatile interest rate environment imaginable everything was fine while the power surplus persisted but when shortages ensued every megawat t was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price second retail markets were not deregulated regulated retail rates remain ed in effect and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out this meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa le prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate they are now nearly bankrupt in short californias problems were caused by regulation not deregulat ion regulations prevented competitors from entering the market prevented new generation from being built and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot prices at the time california was developing its restructuring plan enron warned the states policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives w hich if adopted would have averted the current crisis enrons role many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f ix the problem power sellers including enron have been vilified by the politicians and the media here are the facts other than a small amount of wind power enron is not a generator in the state of california every megawatt we sold in california we bought in the same market available to other california purchasers because we are a market maker not a generator we are not biased toward high prices we ar e interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc ts for our customers as a seller to enduse markets in the state we provided protection from the problems the states utilities and their customers now face we protected and still protect our customers from price volatility you may have read that ees recently elected to have the utilities supply power directly to its customers in california instead of procuring power on the open market early reports mischaracterized this as a turnback of our customers to the utilities here are the facts as a result of a variety of factors existing in the current california market it made more sense for ees to source power for its customers direct ly from the utilities this decision reduced eess market price risk by allowing ees to access lower utility rates ees did not terminate any customer contracts and our customers continue to receive the financial benefits of their contract prices ees is continuing to work with its california customers to provide them with other energyrelated products and services including assistance in reducing the demand for power particularly at peak times enron is currently proposing solutions to help california work out of its crisis enron continues to sign up customers in the state and enron continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in western power markets enrons primary business is managing risk for our custom ers with solutions customized to meet their needs there has never been more demand for our products and services the solution the solution to californias crisis is also straightforward in summary the state must increase supply reduce demand reduce reliance on the spot mark et and shore up the financial stability of the states utilities increasing supply californias process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing short of byzantine enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les s than a year in california it often takes to years california simpl y must streamline this process ironically while many of the regulations generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality the regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and displacing current plants which emit times as much nox california can have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new facilities reducing demand customers in california today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand they pay the same rate no matter what the market price is an open retail market would trigger demand responses which would balance supply and deman d at lower prices than today california should fully open its retail market reducing reliance on the spot market in a truly deregulated market customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer term fixedprice basis the state has instead left procurement in the han ds of the utilities which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the ir price risk restoring the financial integrity of the states institutions the utilities in california are not paying their bills this has led to greater uncertainty in the market higher costs and reduced flexibility to arrive at lasting solutions california must permit its utilities to recov er their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is needed just as important as doing these things the state must avoid policies that while politically attractive do not fix the problem or even make matters worse price caps have been proposed they dont work have never work ed and they will not work here price caps succeed only in creating shortages which then have to be allocated among competing users imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining for example whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the imperial vall ey or silicon valley price caps are a surefire way to make the current shortage worse the state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in california there is no reason to believe and every reason to doubt that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in constructing operating and maintaining assets this will also result in california tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation which the private sector can do instead of education road s and other public goods which the private sector cannot do as you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t he crisis from the media its important for you to know this we at enron will continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real solutions to the state

enron_news ::::::>>>>>> california energy crisis californias power crisis has generated heated debate over the last several months unfortunately this debate has generated more heat than light we want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on california energy issueswhat happened in californiathe source of californias current problem is as straightforward as supply and demand californias economy grew percent since this increased the demand for electricity by percent at the same time regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state so demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added the result predictably is a shortage this summer peak capacity will be about percent shy of peak demand leading to further blackouts in the statein addition to the supply and demand imbalance there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis first the states regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market the spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile the way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases long term medium term and short term to reduce exposure to this volatility in california state regulation prevented this strategy this would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in the most volatile interest rate environment imaginable everything was fine while the power surplus persisted but when shortages ensued every megawatt was purchased at the sky rocketing spot pricesecond retail markets were not deregulated regulated retail rates remained in effect and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out this meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesale prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate they are now nearly bankruptin short californias problems were caused by regulation not deregulation regulations prevented competitors from entering the market prevented new generation from being built and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot pricesat the time california was developing its restructuring plan enron warned the states policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives which if adopted would have averted the current crisisenrons rolemany political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than fix the problem power sellers including enron have been vilified by the politicians and the media here are the facts other than a small amount of wind power enron is not a generator in the state of california every megawatt we sold in california we bought in the same market available to other california purchasers because we are a market maker not a generator we are not biased toward high prices we are interested only in having a market that works so that we can package products for our customers as a seller to enduse markets in the state we provided protection from the problems the states utilities and their customers now face we protected and still protect our customers from price volatilityyou may have read that ees recently elected to have the utilities supply power directly to its customers in california instead of procuring power on the open market early reports mischaracterized this as a turnback of our customers to the utilities here are the facts as a result of a variety of factors existing in the current california market it made more sense for ees to source power for its customers directly from the utilities this decision reduced eess market price risk by allowing ees to access lower utility rates ees did not terminate any customer contracts and our customers continue to receive the financial benefits of their contract prices ees is continuing to work with its california customers to provide them with other energyrelated products and services including assistance in reducing the demand for power particularly at peak timesenron is currently proposing solutions to help california work out of its crisis enron continues to sign up customers in the state and enron continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in western power markets enrons primary business is managing risk for our customers with solutions customized to meet their needs there has never been more demand for our products and servicesthe solutionthe solution to californias crisis is also straightforward in summary the state must increase supply reduce demand reduce reliance on the spot market and shore up the financial stability of the states utilitiesincreasing supplycalifornias process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing short of byzantine enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in less than a year in california it often takes to years california simply must streamline this process ironically while many of the regulations generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality the regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and displacing current plants which emit times as much nox california can have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new facilitiesreducing demandcustomers in california today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand they pay the same rate no matter what the market price is an open retail market would trigger demand responses which would balance supply and demand at lower prices than today california should fully open its retail marketreducing reliance on the spot marketin a truly deregulated market customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer term fixedprice basis the state has instead left procurement in the hands of the utilities which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over their price riskrestoring the financial integrity of the states institutionsthe utilities in california are not paying their bills this has led to greater uncertainty in the market higher costs and reduced flexibility to arrive at lasting solutions california must permit its utilities to recover their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is neededjust as important as doing these things the state must avoid policies that while politically attractive do not fix the problem or even make matters worse price caps have been proposed they dont work have never worked and they will not work here price caps succeed only in creating shortages which then have to be allocated among competing users imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining for example whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the imperial valley or silicon valley price caps are a surefire way to make the current shortage worsethe state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in california there is no reason to believe and every reason to doubt that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in constructing operating and maintaining assets this will also result in california tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation which the private sector can do instead of education roads and other public goods which the private sector cannot doas you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about the crisis from the media its important for you to know this we at enron will continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real solutions to the state

after bridge backimpact to logistics unifyif a counterparty name change takes place to deals that have been bridge backed it could cause problems on edi pipes as that new counterparty name will flow over to unify and repathing should eventually take placeone problem may be with the imbalance data sets which are not in production yetedi imbalance qtys would not match up to pathsthis may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities especially where nominations were sent for entire monthcant remember the rules on this one but i think unify does have some safe guards idiot proofs to force

wants to change a counterparty we created the ability for you to invalidate the deal and then change the counterparty however i did add a warning messagewarning changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes make sure pipeline allows this change some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is feedback i assume for the same reasonswe had this rule it used to blow up our old scheduling systems preunify some pipelines will require a new deal and we will have to zero out the old dealbefore you make the change make sure the logistics person is aware just in case it causes problems with theirpipeline sorry i dont know which pipes these are you will have to ask the unify teamthere is one rule still in place you can change from enaim east to enaim market east but not from enaim texas to hplcim hplc when changing business units they must be the same legal entity warning not the same legal entityalso beware of making contract and counterparty changes to service deals transport capacity storage cash outonce the deal is invalidated there are no rules dont forget the items were locked down for a reason if you invalidate a service deal and change the previously locked down data that was validated and someone used thesedeals in unify it is highly likely that the unify deals and paths created using these deals will get corrupted always check with someone from

mentioned in our hpl staff meeting we are investigating the merits of entering into a joint venture or another transaction structure that will position hpl to effectively compete in the texas intrastate market our primary objective is to gain access to additional sources of gas supply and achieve the required economies of scale to compete with other intrastate pipelines i would appreciate your confidence and support in developing the optimal course of action for hpl and for enron the skills that we have developed in our group are critical to growing our upstream origination business in n america as well as to the ongoing operation of hpl our origination strategy is to leverage our business operations field operations engineering producer services and marketing skills to capture value from transportation gathering storage and commodity opportunities on the gaspower grids we need our current employees to accomplish this objective across n americawe have proven our ability to add value to enron by developing the powderwind river pipelines installing electric compressors contracting for processing capacity and establishing a new gas supply corridor along the gulf coast our recent efforts to provide services such as business operations measurement tradingmarketing and accounting services to third party producers and pipelines also looks to be a promising growth opportunityit is very important to our ongoing business relationships and our competitive position in the market place that we do not discuss hpl related matters with third parties please come see me if you have any specific questions or concerns also please refer any third party inquiries regarding hpl to tim determingregardsbrian 
logistics ::::::>>>>>> new version of stack manager introductionin response to feedback received from enron traders worldwide we have upgraded and improved the stack manager to include new functionality which we hope will improve its effectiveness and usefulness in the management of your productsthis new release will be automatically installed within the next few days please ensure you log out at night in order to receive the upgradesummary of new featuresmultiple children a child product can be the parent of another child multiple links in a chain and different types of links can be placed against a single parentstatic product bar prices when you change a price in the product bar and hit the or button the price stays it does not reset to the amount in product properties until you logoutsorting you can sort by any field on the products tab simply by clicking on the title of the field for multiple sorts hold down your shift keyparent products which are at the top of a stack do not have their basis relationship identified eg the product bar might before have said basis link parent and now would say stand alone parentdetailed feature descriptionsmultiple childrenthe new version of enrononline allows you to link several products together in a long chain for example child product a can be linked to parent product b which is in turn linked to parent product cwarning although there is no absolute limit to the number of links in a chain system performance is degraded by large chains this is because when a customer attempts a transaction the database must lock each and every product in the chain before it can process the transaction request the database must then update the stack for each product before releasing the locks vertical chains multiple parents and children in one long link are much slower to process than flat chains one parent with many children large vertical chains should be avoided related to this feature is the ability to have several types of links on the same parent for example child product a can have a basis link to parent product b at the same time child product c can have a syncopated basis link to the same parent product b parent b is the parent for both a syncopated basis link and a regular basis linkstatic product bar pricesthe new version of enrononline provides for sticky product bar price and volume changes when you change a number on the product bar it does not reset to the number contained in the product properties menu until after you have logged out this makes it easier to update prices volumes spreads or offsets in a changing market without repeated hits to the or buttons one of the benefits of setting these numbers to appropriate levels is that it reduces repeated price movements with the old version of stack manager if the price delta was too small traders would often repeatedly hit the price movement buttons each of these price changes must be communicated across the website to customers and consumes valuable bandwidth this makes it harder for customers to transact with us each time they try a new price update moves the price resulting in an increased transaction failure rate entering an appropriate price into the price delta field and then pressing the price movement button means that fewer but larger price movements are necessary improving overall system response and reducing customer transaction failure rateyou may also notice a new addition to the product bar prices a new field for offset to last trade this allows you to update the offset for products which have offset to last trade selected from the product properties menusortingselectingthe new version of enrononline provide significant additional sorting functionality over the old you can now choose any field heading type location reference period etc and sort by that item you can do multiple sorts by holding down the shift key example if you select type and then location while holding the shift key you will see your products sorted first by product type and then within each product type by location in alphabetical orderif you right click on the product menu you can choose from the same sort criteria plus you can select sort by web order which allows you to see your products in the same order as they would appear to a customer on the website note however that a customer on the website might be also seeing a number of products in addition to the ones you are managingwhen you select products you can drag your mouse while holding down the left mouse button as always but now you can also hold down the ctrl key while making your selections this allows you to highlight products which are not necessarily adjacent to one anotherparent products and fx productsone of the differences in the way that the new version works is in its treatment of how parent products are displayed the old version showed the type of link associated with the parent in the product bar to the left of the main product bar update buttons above the products tabs the new version does not show the type of link this is because the new version allows for more than one type of link on each parent productsome traders may notice that their products which have fx links are now identified with a stylised fx in the product list this is to enable easy identification of products which are run as a foreign exchange link to the parent rather than managed individuallyassistanceas always if you have any problems with any enrononline functionality please contact the hour help desk houston london australia general feedbackif you have any comments on the new functionality or suggestions for further functionality please call david forster on if you had previously suggested new functionality which didnt make it into this release rest assured that you have not been forgotten we are working hard to improve all elements of enrononline and will try to incorporate your requests into the next release of the enrononline stack manager

general business assessment of your team hr challenges should be identified along with needed skill sets gap analysis and succession planning the template below should be used for the format i am not

employees each will be categorized into the six descriptors used in the feedback process i am expecting each of you to have a listing of accomplishments from your employees along with factual feedback and observations which will allow you to place your employees into appropriate categories i would like to stress that the data to sustantiate the performance descriptor should be factual and documented the focus of employee discussions must be on each employees individual contribution towards accomplishing our business goals we must safeguard our discussions from he said she said periferal distractors and focus on the work productpromotion candidates discussiononce again the prc process is a valued process at enron each of you have been through it so you understand the importance of confidentiality additionally the committee will be required to reach an unanimous vote please come to the meeting with your enron hat on not your individual group hat our people are critical to our business therefore it is important for us to be honest when evaluating our staff we must identify our stengths and weaknesses and work towards strengthening our people to ensure the very best business service we can provide what this means is that we should provide our employees with the very best constructive feedback possible in some cases you may be providing a tough message but it is our responsibility and obligation to ensure that each employee fully understands expectations where they are on point and where they are not on point of meeting these expectations so that

topinion richard jaquet tammy superty robert pena matt ccwarner john ripley brian dsouza romeo rao ramesh subjectpath manager rewrite optimization project importancehigh all were currently identifying processes that are inefficient and could possib ly benefit from being rewritten or not even performed going foward i wou ld like bob to appoint a lead business person to whom we could ask question s and or suggest ideas to so that they could in turn validate this informat ion with the desk managersschedulers we had this approach with nomlogic and having clarissa work the issues worked quite nicely who ever you choo se we would need about of their time for now later on with coordina tion efforts and testing it may go up to i dont see that happening for a while though the sooner we get someone to devote to this the better off we will be i expect these changes that well be looking into should improve performance quite a bit that being said weve identified three items that would speed up processin g the retrieval of path manager currently the path manager attempts to reuse path ids i cant think of any reason why we need to perform this extra step it runs through th is processing on the application and generally doesnt find a match i kno w patti has mentioned this several times and i cant think of a valid reaso n for performing this work i talked with dave nommensen and according to him what used to happen is that sometimes schedulers would get duplicate paths out there which is why they put this code in place from a schedul ing perspective my understanding of what your main concern is to just main tain your position and be able to change it if you were overpathed youd see it in the path manager either way pinion richard to restate the question for clarity in path manager a scheduler pulls down a supply mar ket and a service adds any updownstream contract information andor duns or drn override and then saves it unify looks for an old path with those exact variables and if it finds it reuses it and if it does not find an ex act match creates a new path and path id i had been told that to do away with this function would create an unacceptably high amount of paths since any path once nominated on could not be deleted has this changed at o ne time there were some schedulers that looked for the same path activity number match for nominations texas eastern was the only pipeline that ne eded the old activity numbers no matter how long it had been since they wer e used i spoke with chris ordway and the new link system no longer needs this to occur transco uses activity numbers but uses the activity number cross reference table to that function and therefore should not be affected therefore if it does not create a space or memory problem for unify i dont think that this constant old path look up is needed kinsey lisa get rid of this the scheduling position window does anyone use this if not well r emove the code logic that populates this window i have never seen a sched uler use this please verify pinion richard originally such a window was in use by everyone in the legacy system autonoms so it was duplicate d in unify by request it is not used in unify now because of the other so phisticated tools unify provides which obviate its use the only value wo uld be notification of bridge errors or contract imbalances but there are o ther ways to determine those problems as voted on in a previous meeting o f the managers lose it kinsey lisa why is this still here on the inventory pool list does anyone need to see the contarct refere nces list again this code is called every retrieval time and doesnt app ear to be used from my observations if they do need this information we could provide it but if not id prefer to remove the functionality pin ion richard this function is still very much in use by those with poin t based pipelines that must use the imbalance pool to facilitate balancing nomination volumes where multiple pipeline external pools exist and are pat hed through the same contract imbalance pool keep it kinsey lisa ye s we use this functionality a lot when pathing pools when pathing a one to many or many to one set of paths whats the aver age number of paths they create at one time what about updates i know t hat anr and nigas are big users of this feature since they have small packa ges of gas that they are limited in size to does the system seem faster w hen you update one record at a time or chunks of records my real question is how often they do this and for what number of paths on both updates and inserts by update i mean going to the path list and changing an upstre am downstream contract or a psna which in turn forces a new path to be cr eated pinion richard this one to many or many to one pathing goes on every day on every pipeline there is no average they typically updat e a path with updownstream meters or duns or dnb numbers one at a time how ever i hope this answers your question i see no change to this process at this time kinsey lisa on some pipes this function is used more than others when it is used we try and do as many paths as possible at this time i do not see a need to change this process on brokered paths do you want to utilize the same logic we have for se rvice in other words when updating brokered arrangements we dont incor porate the same logic for zeroing out the path and recreating a new arrangm ent link and hence sending it to be renominated why do we do this for ser vice is it because we have to renominate it i assume thats what its f or since we dont send brokered paths to the pipe anyway with the nomlog ic implmentation two way interface we were planning on having it behave the same way as service we need this verified pinion richard we do nt perform the same logic for brokered paths because these are not nominat ed to the pipeline and hence do not need a zero path to be resent to the pi peline when a significant change is made to the already nominated path i dont see a need to change the way brokered paths are behaving at this time kinsey lisa agree with richard

i have included a few paragraphs below from ferc orders that discuss seasonal rates which may be useful to you please let us know if you would like us to look into this any further andrearelated to

intended to reflect costs the applicant must justify the departure from costbased rates cfr obiii ferc at p ue made a valiant effort to comply it attempted to relate the offpeak costs to onpeak by its percent discount argument and reference to its exhibits ue and ue these exhibits amply justify the onpeak costs but offer no cost support for the offpeak discount this discount is chosen as a matter

absence of a detailed cost justification ues offpeak demand charge is rejected reversed see next paragraphcommopinionorder ferc union electric company docket no er july unions proposal to assess a capacity charge for offpeak service under specified circumstances when a customers offpeak demand exceeds twice its highest measured peak demand not only reflects the fact that customers use the companys production and transmission plant offpeak and capacityrelated costs are incurred during those times but also recognizes the equity consideration created by the existence of the peak shaving option to certain customers upon consideration of the evidence presented and the merits of the arguments raised by the parties we reverse the judges ruling and allow the offpeak billing demand provision although we are approving unions use of an offpeak billing demand provision the commission nevertheless believes that a strong incentive continues to exist for customers to peak shave and thus realize cost savings furthermore although we adopt unions approach as reasonable within the context of this case this is not to say that only such an approach is appropriate or that this approach is preferredcommopinionorder ferc florida power corporation docket no er apr urging rejection of fpcs proposed rate increaseon february the public service commission of the state of florida filed a

including the florida commission should it petition to intervene late in this proceedingcommopinionorder ferc commonwealth edison company docket no er mar our review of commonwealths filing indicates that the proposed rates have not been shown to be just and reasonable and may be unjust unreasonable unduly discriminatory or otherwise unlawful therefore we shall accept the proposed rates for filing and suspend those rates for five months to become effective subject to refund on september we note with interest that the proposed rates are designed on a timeofday and seasonal basis the commission has encouraged the use of innovative rate design as a way of more closely matching rates to costs and thereby minimizing misallocation of resources as well as reducing waste inequity and

part of identify the relevant productsthe first step is to identify one or more products sold by the merging entities products may be grouped together when they are good substitutes for each other from the buyers perspective if two products are not good substitutes an entity with market power can raise the price of one product and buyers would have a limited ability to shift their purchases to other products in the past the commission has analyzed three products nonfirm energy shortterm capacity firm energy and longterm capacity these remain reasonable products under the prevailing institutional arrangements and applicants should recognize such products in their analysis other product definitions may also be acceptable for example the lack of onsite buyer storage creates products differentiated by time thus peak and offpeak energy seasonal and daily may be distinct productsaljdec ferc commonwealth edison company docket nos er and er june part of it is commission policy that rate design reflect cost incurrence idaho power co opinion no issued may mimeo at minnesota power and light co opinion no issued april mimeo at in both cases the commission rejected rate design features where there was no evidence in the record showing that the rate design features reflected cost incurrence id in its order setting this proceeding for hearing the commission took note of edisons proposed seasonal differential and specifically directed that the parties fully address the issues related to the cost support for the seasonal rate design commission order issued march mimeo at on october the parties were directed by the presiding judge to identify in their initial briefs the portions of the record that relate to cost support for the seasonal differentialthe requirement that edison provide cost support for its seasonal differential as discussed supra is also set forth in the commissions filing requirements for rate schedules if the rate design is intended to reflect costs the applicant must show how it reflects costs if the rate design is not intended to reflect costs the applicant must justify the departure from costbased rates cfr obiii statement p edisons seasonal differential is intended to lessen the costs imposed upon it by its prominent summer peak edison reasons that since it must build capacity to meet its prominent summer peak charging more in the summer would give customers an incentive to control their summer demands and therefore edisons cost of adding capacity would be reduced tr accordingly edison must show how its seasonal differential reflects the costs imposed on it by summer demand under the commissions filing requirements in cfr obiii statement p further even purpa section d relied upon by edison states that rates shall be on a seasonal basis which reflects the costs of providing service to such class of consumers at different seasons of the year to the extent that such costs vary seasonally for such utility emphasis addedfurther support for relying on marginal rather than average costs comes from the commission itself in its order of march setting this cause for hearing mimeo at the commission in commenting on time of day and seasonal rates mentioned that it encourage innovative rate design to match more closely rates to costs in this regard the commission cited its order no supra at which specifically suggests use of pricing mechanisms based on marginal cost principlesfor jurisdictional wholesale sales under the circumstances in this case where the sale of economy energy is related to edisons costs in adding or eliminating additional excess capacity it is appropriate to establish the price for economy transactions on marginal costs this provides a more close matching of the rate to the cost than would a rate design based on average costs accordingly winnetkas position on pricing of economy energy will not be adopted affirmed and reversed see next paragraphcommopinionorder ferc commonwealth edison company docket nos er and er may turning to commonwealths exceptions we find that the judge correctly rejected the seasonal differential even if we accept the companys interpretation of purpa it still has not cited any record evidence whatsoever of a difference in costs between summer and nonsummer months without at least some showing of a cost difference it is impossible to make a judgment on the reasonableness of the companys proposal we therefore uphold the judge on this pointwe reverse the judges adoption of a price set at of the utilitys incremental costs however and approve the typeb splitsavings method proposed by commonwealth under this method economy transactions are arranged for a hour or similar period at a fixed price based on cost estimates at the time of the agreement if the utilitys incremental costs rise to the point that continued supply would become burdensome the utility may terminate supply we find this method superior

and transmission rate adjustments and extensions december cfr fr historically many purpatype standards have been used in designing wholesale rates for the sale of federal hydroelectric power pmas analyze costs to establish revenue requirements and consider this information in designing rates declining block rates for energy were once used by the pmas but subsequently were found inappropriate and eliminated from rate schedules many of the pmas for years have been effectively using various forms of load management measures in their rate schedules such as scheduling limitations loadshaping capacity and energy overrun charges etc bpa has had a history of using seasonal rates for wholesale firm capacity and energy and also offered its direct service industrial customers interruptible rates some time ago southwestern has had interruptible capacity rates in effect since these examples demonstrate the willingness of the pmas to implement purpatype standards where applicablemany of these purpatype standards when applied appropriately in the design of pma rates can serve to implement the purposes of purpa by encouraging conservation of energy efficient use of resources and

flexibility may take several different forms for instance a contract could provide qfs with a price floor applicable to all the power supplied to the utility but still provide for higher variable unit prices reflecting daily or seasonal periods the price floor would provide the revenue stream necessary for the qf to secure financial support while the price variability would induce the qf to maximize deliveries in peakload periods when the utility values additional supplies most of course the price floor should not exceed the minimum value of the utilitys avoided cost similarly a contract could provide for a two part pricea fixed payment for capacity and an energy price for power delivered the qf would be assured a minimum revenue stream based on the value of its capacity the variable energy component would allow the utility to dispatch the qf capacity only when it was economic whatever the pattern of contract payments rates for purchases from qfs should always reflect how well the characteristics of the suppliers power match the purchasing utilitys need this will ensure that the qf will make most production decisions on the basis of rates reflecting avoided costs rather than the guaranteed average rate and at the same time will receive revenues sufficient to attract investorsto avoid problems such as those associated with takeorpay contracts in the natural gas industry the commission wishes to stress the danger of including forecasted fuel costs in the fixed rate structure of longterm contracts especially in combination with the specification of minimum purchase

sensation they have intheir urine to beat ut and blah blah blah shut up you start to get thefeeling the entire school was built to spite ut forget the fact that when the texas legislature back in the spassed legislation to start a state university they also decided to have asubsidiary branch of the main school university of texas that would teachagriculture and mechanics aggies love to say their school is older fromwhere they get that i dont nowthe fact is the state intended amto be a branch of ut they are like the afterbirth fromthe originalcreation like danny devito in twins so they apparently have this complex so much so that they mustdevotetheir entire school to trying to prove to ut that they are just as goodall the while nobody at ut denies that am is a good school yet theywont shut up so they write a fight songabouttexas and howthey want to beat them they have a fish camp for freshman where they tellthem how bad texas is and how good am and all its traditions are it isthe worlds largest known case of penis envy and it is manifested ineverything am does the people at am now we all have friends who went to am or are atamthere are some nice people there howeverthere is the corp east texasanswer to dreams of rotc kids everywhere for every boy scout who neverlearned to stop playing with his gi joe toys there is the corp nowforget the fact that am will actually let people with subpar gradesenroll if they agree to join the corp forget the fact that the corpslooked like a gestapo hate rally while beating down students on kyle fieldin forget the fact that along with the numerous hazing charges thathave been filed against them and swept under the rug over the years theyjust this past month have had one corps member bring charges againstanother corps member who apparently had been propositioning others for alittle actual sodomy not only could i go on with more instances ofidiocracy by these khakicladshavenheadeddorks i am sure each of youhave your own storiesthe point iswe all respect west point annapolis the air force academy howevernobody respects the corp i imagine they are kind of the laughing stock ofthe military world just because you dress like the army and try and actlike the army does not make you the army people at am dont even respectthese clowns it is not cool to shave your head and dress up halloween isonly supposed to be one day of the year if you want to carry guns and beatup civilians move to israel it is even less cool to slobber on somebodys daughter on nationaltelevision and call it a tradition dry humping year old girls in thestands at football games is not cool not only is it not cool it should beagainst the law i know that in college station students are just prone tomount each other on the campus lawn or in the middle of class or anytimeanything good happens you can just grab the girl sitting next to you andstart sucking on her face but everywhere else in the world it is lookeddown upon especially if you are doing it on my tv that is why we havemoved the game from thanksgiving because people across the nation weregagging on their turkey when in the middle of watching a football gamesome boy scout is tongue thrashing some overweight coed during somebodysthanksgiving dinner we do not need to see burly women engaged in asuckfest every time your woeful offense manages to put points on the boardsome of these girls are in desperate need of a trip to the cliniquecounter screw that forget makeup it is too late for that just givethem a veil tu is not funny it is not insulting it is dumb just imagine iffolks from texas kept talking about ma and giggling that would not befunny in fact it would be retarded thats why ut fans dont do itplease learn you want to lose the image of country bumpkins of a people fond ofsheep of people that arent stupid then quit building things that falldownquit chasing cheerleaders around with swords on national tv quitwhooping in church quit whooping period quit putting up scoreboards forthe enjoyment of dead mammals quit spending your friday nights practicinghow to yell quit telling rape jokes to reporters when youre running forgovernor when you are filling out season ticket renewals and the formasks for your phone h w quit putting height weight just collectively stop making asses of yourselves go to easttexas tour every small town and ask every red neck with a th gradeeducation why they cheer for am and wear maroon that is your fan basethis is why you are perceived by the educated masses as stupid nobody cares if you think your band is better they might be louderthey might march in neat little zig zags but they have no musical ability the point is nobody cares who wins halftime quit getting geeked up aboutmarching bands i find it hard to believe you stood through your highschool bands entire halftime performance and why cause nobody cared thenand nobody cares now plus you can hear them fine sitting down even if youdo care why is it cool all of a sudden now that youre in college men should never let out high pitched whooping sounds perhaps theonlyjustifiable situation in which this can be tolerated is perhaps

personal ::::::>>>>>> marketing servicesscheduling darenthinking about roberts little memo yesterday and along the lines of pulling the marketing sitara function back to your side of the fence i think a strong case could be made in favor of that ideait is obvious that several people are involved in changing tickets pathing nominating and confirming the industrials this dissipates the knowledge base and the responsibility factor it is a whos on first issueif the responsibility to ensure pricing volume and accomplishment of market intent is accurately depicted and in sitara is in your shop then the schedulers could concentrate on the accuracy and correctness of unify and pops im sure this would help volume management and client services immenselyas the skill level rises in this area you could then gradually feed more and more of the marketing function sitara to the scheduling group in the hopes they would then have a better understanding of the overhaul picturei believe the current situation is too much too fast for scheduling to handle all at once it has also created a situation where robert seems to think not only that he has all the segments mastered but that he is the only person that should be involved in the industrialsi will support whatever direction you want to go on this issue but if you and pat leave things the way they are please explain to both robert and pat that others may be involved in the industrial activity and that is quite alrightonce again thanks for listeningken atthtm

with my good friend alex janet leist andtheir wonderful children over the five days i stayed at their house alexand i listened to a lot of music and one of the guys we both liked wassunny jim i bought one of james cds from alex and fell in love with itimmediately the cd was his second called life in the laid back lanelittle did i know that i would meet up with james and his roady shady floydseveral times over the next six months james was embarking on his first realtour of the us since he moved down island almost twelve years ago we gotseveral chances to talk over the summer and we will have an in depth articleabout this expatriate soon on the expatriate zone web site be sure towatch for itin the meantime here are a couple of quick things i learned about this greatmusician when i asked him about his expatriate status his reply wastechnically an expatriate is someone who lives outside their own countryfor whatever reason for some its legal reasons others just because theywant to or thats where the work is i have been an expatriate for nearlytwelve years now i have pretty fully lived the whole caribbean experiencefrom climbing the coconut trees and spear fishing to sailing scuba divinghot afternoons on the beach and romantic moonlit nights under the swayingpalmseven as james is about to repatriate himself and his family i ask if therewere any other places he would consider living as an expatriate maybesomewhere on the coast of mexico or in a group of islands that are all withinsailing distance of one another was the advice he gaveuntil we can learn more of sunny jims

you can do original message from kenneth r pybus krpybusbizjournalscomto recipient list suppressedsent wednesday november amsubject fwd gop action plan what you can do i got this from paul sperry at worldnetdaily i dont know who joe morris is but this sounds like a plan note that this has been circulating since last thursday united republican fund of illinois chicago november from joseph a morris president to urf leaders and friends herewith is some practical advice on action that every citizen can take in the event that the florida recount confirms the election of george bush but al gore fails to concede we all know what is going on in florida and that the election hinges on the outcome i am writing you today to prepare us all for what we will have to do if what i think is going to happen actually does the recount which will be finished by pm thursday will likely show bush to be the winner once again with only a few thousand overseas ballots to be counted those ballots will be overwhelmingly for bush a minimum of and probably closer to if the count goes our way tomorrow we have won this election this is when something critical happens either gore bows out gracefully or he doesnt and i can almost guarantee he wont these are people wedded to power who will only go down kicking and screaming they will use every legal maneuver in the book to steal the election in when richard nixon had every right and reason to challenge the election results he didnt for the sake of the country expect no such noble behavior this time what will they try one bet is to find a friendly judge to throw out the florida results on a flimsy premise they are already floating this as a trial balloon in the form of the allegedly confusing ballots in palm beach county i have seen the ballots they are not confusing in the least indeed they are identical in form to the punchcard ballots used in chicago and cook county illinois in this very election what is more it is just as likely that palm beach county voters who wanted to vote for bush inadvertently voted for nader all parties approved the form of ballot before the election the formofballot issue is a mere pretext for an effort a judicial invalidation of the florida election while i hope this scenario doesnt come to pass i fear that it will and it will only have disastrous results for the country the election fight could drag on for months and actually be decided by a court if this comes to pass the vision of our founders and the blood of patriots will have been betrayed personally i am not going to stand for this and i hope you wont either the good news is that we are not without voice here is what must be done if the vote count affirms bushs election we allow a short grace period to see the reaction of the gore camp if they have not graciously conceded after a few hours we must bombard the news media and our public officials at every level with phone calls of outrage that demand gores concession i mean literally millions of phone calls we must jam their phone banks with callsthere are millions of us so it shouldnt be too difficult while youre at it send emails to your local newspapers as well if it becomes widely reported and it will that there is a groundswell demanding that gore back down and not embarrass the country it will be very difficult for gore to withstand the pressure he will have to relent here are some places to start the white house telephone fax email presidentwhitehousegov the vice presidents office telephone fax email vicepresidentwhitehousegov vice presidents senate office

light of yesterdays eventstribute to the united states this from a canadian newspaper is worth sharingamerica the good neighbor widespread but only partial news coverage was given recently to a remarkable editorial broadcast from toronto by gordon sinclair a canadian television commentator what follows is the full text of his trenchant remarks as printed in the congressional record this canadian thinks it is time to speak up for the americans as the most generous and possibly the least appreciated people on all the earth germany japan and to a lesser extent britain and italy were lifted out of the debris of war by the americans who poured in billions of dollars and forgave other billions in debts none of these countries is today paying even the interest on its remaining debts to the united states when france was in danger of collapsing in it was the americans who propped it up and their reward was to be insulted and swindled on the streets of paris i was there i saw it when earthquakes hit distant cities it is the united states that hurries in to help this spring american communities were flattened by tornadoes nobody helped the marshall plan and the truman policy pumped billions of dollars into discouraged countries now newspapers in those countries are writing about the decadent warmongering americans id like to see just one of those countries that is gloating over the erosion of the united states dollar build its own airplane does any other country in the world have a plane to equal the boeing jumbo jet the lockheed tristar or the douglas dc if so why dont they fly them why do all the international lines except russia fly american planes why does no other land on earth even consider putting a man or woman on the moon you talk about japanese technocracy and you get radios you talk about german technocracy and you get automobiles you talk about american technocracy and you find men on the moon not once but several times and safely home again you talk about scandals and the americans put theirs right in the store window for everybody to look at even their draftdodgers are not pursued and hounded they are here on our streets and most of them unless they are breaking canadian laws are getting american dollars from ma and pa at home to spend here when the railways of france germany and india were breaking down through age it was the americans who rebuilt them when the pennsylvania railroad and the new york central went broke nobody loaned them an old caboose both are still broke i can name you times when the americans raced to the help of other people in trouble can you name me even one time when someone else raced to the americans in trouble i dont think there was outside help even during the san francisco earthquake our neighbors have faced it alone and im one canadian who is damned tired of hearing them get kicked around they will come out of this thing with their flag high and when they do they are entitled to thumb their nose at the lands that are gloating over their present troubles i hope canada is not one of those stand proud america wear it proudlythis is one of the best editorials that i have ever read regarding the united states it is nice that one man realizes it i only wish that the rest of the world would realize it we are always blamed for everything and never even get a thank you for the things we do i would hope that each of you would send this to as many people as you can and emphasize that they should send it to as many of their friends until this letter is sent to every person on

unify ::::::>>>>>> re sitara release re changes in global due to consent to assignment changing counterparty names on sitara deal tickets has absolutely no impact to any downstream processes i hope the following will give more clarification let me know if you have any questions or need more detail thanksdg sitara unify process scenario counterparty name changes on sitara deal ticket after deal had been pathed scheduled bridged back from unify impact zero impact to logistics volume management absolutely harmless settlements has process in place to eliminate issues process counterparty a in sitara changes to counterparty b ctprty a was on original path sent to pipeline the new name ctprty b does bridge over to unifyctprty a remains at the path level in unify gui display does not changectprty b is now displayed at the deal level in unify the field is now highlighted to indicate a change occurred gui display changes only at high level not on paththe scheduler has choice to repath if necessary or not repathif repathing occurs the new counterparty name will be displaced on new pathunify pushes back the deal number meter to sitara not ctprty infobalancing works on deal number meter only not ctprty infothe confirmation desk utilizes the information in sitara where all information is correctvolume management utilizes the information in unify for pipeline tieout all information sent to pipeline is correct at the path level and will match up perfectlysettlements utilizes information in unify settlements recognizes that changed ctprty names changes contracts which would create two notification entriesif invoice did happen to go out to wrong ctprty redraft would occurnote there was an issues discovered on reports which it is correcting nowautonoms toms words of warning previously there was an issue when counterparty name changes took place after deals were pathed and nominated basically it would change a key on an edi path duns number not affecting any other of the information already nominated to the pipeline if the scheduler renominated data at the pipeline would get doubled up and the scheduler would have no way to correct the problem in most cases the schedulers would have to get the pipeline to manually cut the original nominated volume this is not an issue with unify as explained abovedave feel free to chime in if i left anything out from donna

optimization project following are my comments the managers ccd might have some additional th oughts original message from pena matt sentmonday october pm topinion richard jaquet tammy superty robert pena matt ccwarner john ripley brian dsouza romeo rao ramesh subjectpath manager rewrite optimization project importancehigh all were currently identifying processes that are inefficient and could possib ly benefit from being rewritten or not even performed going foward i wou ld like bob to appoint a lead business person to whom we could ask question s and or suggest ideas to so that they could in turn validate this informat ion with the desk managersschedulers we had this approach with nomlogic and having clarissa work the issues worked quite nicely who ever you choo se we would need about of their time for now later on with coordina tion efforts and testing it may go up to i dont see that happening for a while though the sooner we get someone to devote to this the better off we will be i expect these changes that well be looking into should improve performance quite a bit that being said weve identified three items that would speed up processin g the retrieval of path manager currently the path manager attempts to reuse path ids i cant think of any reason why we need to perform this extra step it runs through th is processing on the application and generally doesnt find a match i kno w patti has mentioned this several times and i cant think of a valid reaso n for performing this work i talked with dave nommensen and according to him what used to happen is that sometimes schedulers would get duplicate paths out there which is why they put this code in place from a schedul ing perspective my understanding of what your main concern is to just main tain your position and be able to change it if you were overpathed youd see it in the path manager either way pinion richard to restate the question for clarity in path manager a scheduler pulls down a supply mar ket and a service adds any updownstream contract information andor duns or drn override and then saves it unify looks for an old path with those exact variables and if it finds it reuses it and if it does not find an ex act match creates a new path and path id i had been told that to do away with this function would create an unacceptably high amount of paths since any path once nominated on could not be deleted has this changed at o ne time there were some schedulers that looked for the same path activity number match for nominations texas eastern was the only pipeline that ne eded the old activity numbers no matter how long it had been since they wer e used i spoke with chris ordway and the new link system no longer needs this to occur transco uses activity numbers but uses the activity number cross reference table to that function and therefore should not be affected therefore if it does not create a space or memory problem for unify i dont think that this constant old path look up is needed kinsey lisa get rid of this the scheduling position window does anyone use this if not well r emove the code logic that populates this window i have never seen a sched uler use this please verify pinion richard originally such a window was in use by everyone in the legacy system autonoms so it was duplicate d in unify by request it is not used in unify now because of the other so phisticated tools unify provides which obviate its use the only value wo uld be notification of bridge errors or contract imbalances but there are o ther ways to determine those problems as voted on in a previous meeting o f the managers lose it kinsey lisa why is this still here on the inventory pool list does anyone need to see the contarct refere nces list again this code is called every retrieval time and doesnt app ear to be used from my observations if they do need this information we could provide it but if not id prefer to remove the functionality pin ion richard this function is still very much in use by those with poin t based pipelines that must use the imbalance pool to facilitate balancing nomination volumes where multiple pipeline external pools exist and are pat hed through the same contract imbalance pool keep it kinsey lisa ye s we use this functionality a lot when pathing pools when pathing a one to many or many to one set of paths whats the aver age number of paths they create at one time what about updates i know t hat anr and nigas are big users of this feature since they have small packa ges of gas that they are limited in size to does the system seem faster w hen you update one record at a time or chunks of records my real question is how often they do this and for what number of paths on both updates and inserts by update i mean going to the path list and changing an upstre am downstream contract or a psna which in turn forces a new path to be cr eated pinion richard this one to many or many to one pathing goes on every day on every pipeline there is no average they typically updat e a path with updownstream meters or duns or dnb numbers one at a time how ever i hope this answers your question i see no change to this process at this time kinsey lisa on some pipes this function is used more than others when it is used we try and do as many paths as possible at this time i do not see a need to change this process on brokered paths do you want to utilize the same logic we have for se rvice in other words when updating brokered arrangements we dont incor porate the same logic for zeroing out the path and recreating a new arrangm ent link and hence sending it to be renominated why do we do this for ser vice is it because we have to renominate it i assume thats what its f or since we dont send brokered paths to the pipe anyway with the nomlog ic implmentation two way interface we were planning on having it behave the same way as service we need this verified pinion richard we do nt perform the same logic for brokered paths because these are not nominat ed to the pipeline and hence do not need a zero path to be resent to the pi peline when a significant change is made to the already nominated path i dont see a need to change the way brokered paths are behaving at this time kinsey lisa agree with richard

commoditylogic ::::::>>>>>> commoditylogiccom mikefurther to our conversation here are some of the things i thought of while speaking with tom gros there are definitely some challenges we have to overcome to make the hub idea within commoditylogiccom as successful as enrononline rather than have it turn out like sitarai wont repeat thoughts about how we split cl from enron but lets put ourselves in the shoes of somebody external for whom this was presented as a potential solution well thats an easy decision somebody else is doing the hard work and not charging us very much for it so signup but dont rely on anything until we see everything workinghandling counterparties not using the systemthe challenge here is that the final solution world with overybody using the hub is wonderful but until everybody is using the hub we have to keep other procedures and systems going which stretches resources development it support and user this was why we decided to delay getting bolero the concept is wonderful but the value to any user is very dependent on everyone else one trades with using the system this is classic chicken and egg tom has a vision of cl providing the staff to handle this this is taking us closer to an outsourcetoandersenconsulting model which is certainly achievable although not quite such an easy sellhow much resource is leftthe latest project always tends to attract the most imaginative people who are therefore not available for keeping everything else going and moving onwards how about if we accept that such resource is dedicated to cl and then review what is left in the remaining environment does it mean we hold off doing anything if we do then increasing volume means that we might end up incurring costs for massive numbers of people we should go through costing for what happens if we completely stop development of x project if that shows one would need clerks for years until something else comes along then it may be cheaper than developing but i hope in most cases it is notstart small to prove concepteg first application in april only covers fieldsthis is excellent and we neednt shout it too loud to investors in cl but for our internal back office costing we need to acknowledge that it will be years before we can switch off many internal systemswe might limit the payback period on projects not part of this strategy to years outinclude european aspects from the beginningthis really isnt very difficult so long as one has some longoncommonsense europeans not just brits involved in both specification and development from the beginning but an as example of how not to do it look at enpower which took a year to allow just for currencies etc rule for types of transactioneol has shown the benefits of focussing on simpler products firstonce we have robust warehouses for collecting accounting dtl and risk risktrac numbers then we can think about having vanilla products on stp and yettobecomevanilla products on explicitly different manual approaches until that time we have a strong desire to include as many different prodcuts as possible for a given commodity in one system which makes separating vanillas from others more complicated and costly think of certain deals in power which are approximations of the actual deals and manually tweaked every so oftentestingtoms first thought is that we could leverage initial users who would not pay to do much of the testingeol clearly got its testing done but other experience shows that in order to have anything which saves time one really does need to do all the different phases component system integration endtoend and then useracceptanceeol saw confidentiality as an issue and was therefore unable to use many external users early in the process it did have massive resourcecommandability and so obtained input from many traders do the support functions have sufficient slack that they will be able to provide the same sort of user attention given how often i hear short people that strikes me as something which in london would require significant additional resource even after mg is absorbedwhat else did you come up withrichard

commoditylogic ::::::>>>>>> contacts for commodity logic during my meeting with kathryn cordes the other day i mentioned to her that i was having lunch with mirant formerly southern company energy mktg and wanted to know the status of any contact that tom gros may have had with them so that i would know how to handle my discussions with them early on we had asked that commoditylogic target companies like aep and mirant for confirmlogic kathryn mentioned that they were also thinking of talking to el pasotom called me yesterday and asked for a contact name at el paso i told him about my planned lunch with mirant as well he asked me to get a contact name for mirant as well i received some information from mirant today that actually helps our case for confirmlogic they informed me that they have just visited with aep regarding deals transacted on the intercontinental power exchange ice platform mirant is a stakeholder in that trading platform aep wants to eliminate confirmations for trades on that platform and want the automatch function he said that aeps it dept is ready to take that step he also made the comment that mirants it dept is very lacking and is not ready to perform the automatch function he did say that they would be receptive to verifying the deal information electronically and eliminating the confirmations he felt that technology wise they were years behind where we are our advantage is that we want to automatch the entire universe of deals broker eol direct trades trades done on other platforms ie dynegy direct ice etc rather than just a subset of deals ie trades done on ice as aep suggestedjust want to pass this on to you to see if you had any concerns about providing this information to tom i was planning on sending him an email tomorrow to give him the contact information let me knowkim theriot

doorstep ::::::>>>>>> doorpost post doorstep in my response to brent price on the london doorstep review i alluded to the incompleteness of the list of issues as i outlined the key point has been identified but its knock on effects are widespread and worrying especially as they concern the continental power operationas of today the most recent finalised dpr for this business was for th may and during the period between then and now we have seen although in milder form a repeat of the turmoil on the amsterdam power exchange apx that we witnessed in january this year this is not the time or the market to not know our positionthe business is soon to apply for higher limits to accommodate a new transaction on the polish border i am bound to comment that based on the state it appears to be in i would not recommend higher limitsto add insult to injury as a result of the way this area has been allowed to develop much of the knowhow is in the heads and spreadsheets of certain key individuals who it seems are now bound rapidly for ebs uk gas seems to have slipped too yesterday they reported a m loss due to the value of a set of options which were part of a structured deal booked offsystem and not revalued for over a month worryingly there seemed to be more time spent arguing over the nuances of a loss notification memo than answering some fundamental questions about why it happenedas a corollary our process of performing risk reviews has become all the more important in identifying holes in our capture and treatment of market risk in the firm i expect these to play a big part in our effort to stabilise these areas dp forwarded by david portmarket riskcorpenron on am from david port am to brent a pricehouectectcc mike jordanlonectect steve w younglonectect

sherrifflonectect subject re project doorstep responsibility matrix thanks for the summary i was out last week so apologies if my comments arrive too late here they are anyway socratesi think it inappropriate for me or anyone in rac for that matter to have primary responsibility for this systemprojectbut if i were responsible the first thing i would want to know is why this project which commenced in may as i recall is still incomplete given that it now contains possibly the largest energy derivative position in history concentrated in a single commodity with a single counterpart exhaustive it doesnt look like an exhaustive list and i suspect it was not intended to be so nevertheless we should ensure it is not viewed as such symptoms or causes many of the points look like the former and addressed as they stand will likely leave us with a bandaid solution which will drop off when pressure is applied in fact many of them look like they are a result of point prioritisation of system projects has resulted in a lack of certain control functionalitybecause that explains partly why models get built and forgotten confirmation errors get made deliveries go astray and trades get missed usually bright people are simply too immersed in manual processes to have time to think about changing the way they work and for example when those people move on as they surely will the institution has no memory of how to do what they did i am still amazed at how much we pay relatively senior people to work on microsoft excel all day everyday overalli think this is a good exercise if we react to it in the right way rather than a list of irritating issues we have to do just enough to justify ticking off we should use it as a tool to analyse the way we operateas a hypothesis if most issues stem from point then i would ask why has prioritisation of system projects resulted in a lack of certain control functionality dp brent a priceect amto mike jordanlonectect steve w

summary covers all the issues shonapoint comes up in doorstep after doorstep it was discussed extensively upon being raised in the singapore doorstep and andy cowx telecoms expert for enron europe researched potential solutions without success i cant help but feel that as this is a global issue a global solutionanswer needs to be found shona can you take this up with either sally or ted and find someone accountable for coming up with a global answerpoint per the updated list of authorised traders and follow up note to sam hainsworth defining scope of what chicago and montreal maymay not do any residual position that chicago may create is preauthorised by sam and is an integral part of his global book i have forwarded the follow up note to shona this morning and confirmed with sam that he has communicated the contents with his staff in those offices ie no local limits however small are requiredpoint lous list of as development needs has been prioritised and depending on where on this list the improvements to customer reports are this should be done in the very near futurepoint we considered preserving the helsinki typewriter in perspex as a reminder to us all however i am assured it has now been destroyed suggest that once the forms have been converted this machine is rendered useless eg remove the e key or take a spanner to itper the point you make about the timing of moving the scrap business i will assume that the timing is acceptable to houston unless we hear concerns to the contrarythanks and regardstimmarcelo parramgusa to mike jordanlonectect tim poullainpattersonlonectect naomi connelllonectectcc subject chicago doorstep reviewplease find dereks report on the visit by the houston riskcontrolling team assuming that this summary covered all the issues it seems that we are making progress point the problem with the phones will be addressed when they move to the other enron office i agree that the sooner the move takes place the better but lets make sure that they are properly set up in the new office prior to their move the critical part of the move is to assure that availability to the as is established prior to the movepoint using cell phones needs to be addressed how are you controlling this in london and other officesonce we transfer the scrap business to london jan we will not have position issues in chicago until that time comes please note that chicago has been instructed not to take any positions in the event of an unbalanced book with an agreement from sam they will need a small limit tim can you formalize this with sam see point below for good order sakepoint we need a better customer exposure report from the as mike sweeny should help us on this frontpoint russiabills of ladingtypewriter helsinki is still fresh in our minds what can i say i told them to unplug the machinepoint stephanie reporting to lou is not a problem derek doing logistics and assisting the traders is not a problem since we have taken away

recap of issues bob i discussed yesterday withshona wilson david port bjorn hagelmann we explained how all confirmspricingsinvoices were now sentdirectly to counterparties from ny not chicago david port was very concerned that we were not using taped phones yetand will push this issue upon return to houston as reason for us to moveto ena before thanksgiving perhaps as early as next weekend discussed problems with confirming business when out of the office on homephones cell phones or external meetingsa conversations not taped suggested that a conference call be made toa taped line at our office to record the transaction or that someone from theoffice call the counterparty directly to confirm the contractb they were concerned about fixing prices without a screen we explained thatmostly we only fix premiumsdiscounts for later pricing when fixing a price thetrader would either call the office or lme broker for a live quote and for hedging we explained that we do not have formal position limits because our bookis more or less fully hedged as per jrs memo david asked if we had anyinformal limits to which we suggested mt due to buying selling throughthe course of the day but unhedged positions if any would not be left openunless discussed with approved by sam we agreed that credit functions reporting should be strengthened especiallyto show total exposures by customers not just limits or receivables shona will follow up with alan aronowitz to finalize gtcsmaster agreements asap shona asked about progress with agency agreements lou please add this toyour action plan with naomi connell in london as responsible party showed them our daily positions as positions which they agreed were ingood order explained that ny reconciles positions daily and chicago

doorstep ::::::>>>>>> doorstep meeting sallyfollowing our doorstep meeting today i am following up on your request that i forward to you the list of portland transactions for which we still require documentation eg invoices sap entries etc for the settlements testing only we reduced the deal population from to ten randomlyselected transactions in order to facilitate the settlement groups ability to complete both its monthly close obligations and our doorstep request the deal selection is indicated in yellow and the missing items in greenalso per your request attached are the five nonstandard deals for which we have been unable to obtain any information at all our primary need is just to get a basic understanding of these transactionscolorado springs utilities colorado mwsbpa nw delivered mwswelded tube pge nw mwsbritish columbia power exchange cob mwsharbor cogenthank you for your help sallyken 
doorstep ::::::>>>>>> staffing for doorstep since we couldnt get us all together on the phone sally youre out of the office i wanted to close the loop on some of the discussions weve all been having on doorstep after talking with rick carson shona and i see several alternativesour needs database management staff to do the deal test and write the reportno matter what we want to use rick carsons group to maintain the doorstep database our goalsthe one open question we need to resolve is whether or not rick buy does in fact want rick carsons group to develop trading expertise with the goal of being able to do doorstep visits alone without the involvement of market risk management mrm or sallys ops group rick carson indicated that was his understanding from talking to rick buy if that is the case we should select alternative below despite the inefficienciesif we are simply trying to carry out the doorstep initiative in the most efficient manner possible it seems carsons involvement is not actually the way to get therealternatives include rick carsons group to staff the deal test while including them in planning interviews etc rc does not have low level people to do deal test only his people are experienced managersdirectors who would only be interested in participating if they were learning the trading business it is also a management problem for his staff to be under someone elses direction so he wants their more active involvement pros inclusion in interviews might shorten turn around time for them documenting the findings in the report training of a rcs group is this in fact a goal cons no real need for a rd level of brains we just need brawn involvement by or more people in interviews might be intimidating to target personnel may be inefficient etc planning and oversight with groups in charge is inefficient and could cause accountability question dont use rick carsons group except for database management instead consider one of the following a have the mrm and ops people assigned to the doorstep do the deal test and write the report bring a staff level person from mrm or ops to do the deal test pros efficient keeps expertise and training within our two groups who can benefit most directly as trading is our focus vs carsons group no issue with managing staff etc issue do our two groups mrm and ops have resources necessary to devote b outsource to aa cons little leverage on timeliness of report not developing in house expertise expensive c see if there are other internal resources like the business risk management energy assurance services group internal audit or accountants from causeys other groups etcassuming buy does not actually plan to transfer responsbility for doorstep to carsons group i think shona and i are leaning toward a it depends on what you two think about it i think our staff level people would welcome the opportunity to participate and see other offices the question is can we afford time wise for them to do so but if we want to train carsons group with the idea of them eventually becoming the primary rac doorstep interface we can do that insteadlet us know what you think so we can finalize our staffing plans regardscassandra

entelligence ::::::>>>>>> re dun bradstreet info for credit trading thank you for keeping us in the loop on this db data will become one of our most important sources as you suggest the intent is to use this data along with other available date to generate a price for credit the price will be published externally likely for a fee and as a free service via the web or via automated processes option appears to be the best solution for us given our desire for as up to date data as possible stuart is working with the credit team to define additional data elements but the credit score and financial score are likely what we are looking for alternatively if it is possible to obtain the actual data that is used to generate the score that would allow us to generate our own score in addition to dbs we will need the global failure score as well currently we are active in europe as well as the us and expect to move towards asia and austrailia over time hopefully this data is available via db connectanother consideration is the term of contract we would likely prefer a longer term contract so that if they decide they dont like what we are doing with the data we cannot be cut off does it make sense from your perspective to approach db to be our long term strategic providor of customer data this would likely make their deal maker look good in his bosss eyes give you lots of negotiating ability and give a us the long term preferential contract that we are looking forlets discuss furtherbryanmary solmonson to john sherrifflonectect bryan seyfriedlonectectcc philippe a bibihouectect sally beckhouectect stuart ffoulkeslonectect subject dun bradstreet info for credit tradingi have received preliminary information from db i think several issuesquestions have been raised that if explored could result in a better solution for the money option the update frequency for our current file can be improved from quarterly to monthly for a cost of usd through march option i wasnt sure what specific data in the file you might be interested in if you are particularly interested in the financial stress score and credit score for example there are multiple alternatives a keep quartlery refresh of base data party name etc and refresh scores that are addedchanged on a monthly basis cost usd per record note that there are records in the file currently with financial and credit scores making this potentially a very expensive alternative x b batch or ftp updates of the financial and stress scores can only be provided monthly db is working on a solution that would provide a weekly update to their customers in a batch or ftp manner but has not committed to when this will be ready therefore if more timely updates than monthly are desired it is also possible to transactionally access records one at a time using dbs software the cost for this is extremely high at usd per score option db connect product db connect is a tool set of matching software an externally validated reference file credit and marketing information and db services that enables the most effective integration of customer information and thirdparty information with db information only this type of process and information integration capability can facilitate and ensure accurate identification linkage and maintenance of your customers complete relationship in addition db connect assures organizations of referential integrity by providing an automated and electronic link to db so that the most recent db information is always transmitted to your organization and updated within your local db connect reference file db connect is scalable cost typically ranging from customer access module cam batch cam online full information integrator datawith more specifics as to your needs this option should perhaps be pursuedquestionsissues db had questions regarding the use of their data and whether enron customers would be offered this information for a fee or free i explained that i did not feel the data would be offered directly to enron customers but that it would be used to support analysis that would be available externally via web site etc all pricing above is based upon this understanding if i have not portrayed the usage correctly it will be imperative to get a better understanding before final pricing can be negotiated are there specific data elements that you are interested in alternatives may vary by data element financial stress score and credit score reference above were explored as an example what is timeframe for needing a solution financial stress score and credit score are only available on us companies a comparable measure global failure score the liklihood of default or bankruptcy is available for international companies this rating score however is not currently available via a batch or ftp manner this could result in additional cost if we wish to pursue obtaining this score in a batch manner pricing also varies whether the information is to be used for credit analysis or risk management decisions versus for marketing purposes this is probably negotiable as the data is the same the thought process is that if the repository is used for credit or risk decisions db will see decreased usage and revenue on a transactional basis by the credit departments if you would like me to follow up further please give me a call at

eol ::::::>>>>>> it issues i just wanted to make sure you were aware of one thing in case it comes up on friday or you can bring it up if you would like the only real system issues we have outside of enrononline it resources are the bridge resources currenlty eol deals bridge to tagg sitara and enpower we have had some issues in the past trying to get bridge issues corrected and nail down reasons for bridge failures among other things the problem has arisen due to the fact that each bridge really only has one person that is fully capable of correcting problems and until last week these three individuals really did not have anyone defining the bridge as part of their day to day responsibilities when tom moore left early this year these guys were left in limbo luckily they were seldom out and all three of them were very good at getting back to us for the most part now for the good news jennifer and i had a meeting with richard burchfield last week the bridges are now part of his world this was initiated by a memo jennifer copied beth on regarding bridge failures i will forward this to you as well richard understands the importance of the bridge and ensured us that he will add some structure to this group it is especially critical when the sitara bridge goes down late morning and we are doing next day physical deals on enrononline i have a good working relationship with him from the old synergi days so i think this will be great for us i provided him copies of the it compliance flow charts related to the bridges so that he could gain an understanding of how they work since this meeting jennifer has contacted additional resources that richard referred us to and they have been very responsive one of the guys volunteered his pager and told us to call him any time regarding any bridge so that said hopefully our only issue is correcting itself due to jennifers perseveranceapart from that we do have an item on our wish list enrononline it to simplify the messages that are sent across the bridges to hopefully speed up processing time right now the bridges have to do a lot of thinking to determine how to book certain deals we want to eliminate that thinking by adding a deal type identifier on the deal which will automatically tell the bridge what to do i can give you more details on this if youd like but this is short and sweet explanationlet me know if you have any questionsthanksst

eol ::::::>>>>>> cutoff time for eol gas transactions i talked to each of you a couple of weeks ago and this topic got pushed aside due to some other pressing issues however each of you agreed that a standard cutoff time was acceptable for us gas power and liquids products the best option will be to agree to cutoff at pm each day just to get an idea of the numbers we were talking about i looked at yesterday to determine how many deals were traded after pm houston time we had three us gas deals and two canadian gas deals after pm the bridges would automatically roll new eol deals to the next day however for those deals that do not bridge after pm the various risk groups would need to remember that these deals are the following days business i am not sure how the procedures in risk would need to be modified for the traders position reports as the official books would not include these late deals can risk run supplemental reports to ensure that the desks have accurate positions each morning i would appreciate any comments that you may have and regardless please reconfirm that a cutoff of pm works for each of your respective groupssherixmike any potential problems with the dprpeggy we discussed briefly a few weeks backany thoughts

with the as application a better understanding of the inconsistency between stock reconciliation reports and concerns over the useability of the outright stock screen enquiry are such that i am currently not confident of delivering sufficient accurate information to aa to satisfy their audit requirements which at a macro level is the transparent audit trail between stock and forward

balance may be misstated due to data issues above and beyond existing conversations with aa on model simplificationsthat there are reconciling differences between trader position analyses as on screen

europe ::::::>>>>>> re doorstep review process thanks for your note sally that is very helpful i think my main concern is to ensure that we have the most effective and efficient communication between the doorstep team and the business unit i would like john and i to be more involved in the process so that the team can put the situation in context so that they know our concerns in addition to any they may have it is also important to be clear as to what has already been identified and is being addressed and how while i understand that part of the idea of doorstep is to rattle the cages of the commercial management it is important to check if my cage is already rattling as it was in this case john and i would always expect to see and discuss a report before it is discussed in houston unless there is a very good reason to do otherwise i take any issues of a control nature very seriously but my approach is to insist on a verification of the facts before making any judgements which does lead to some delay on occasion while facts are being gathered what i would also like in addition to a briefing and discussion at the start of the review is a debrief from the team to get their impressions directly both as to the issues and also as to how my control teams are doing there is always a question of prioritisation of resource particularly in businesses like metals which will be a constant challenge going forward you will have similar issues on steel etc and i would like the doorstep team to provide me with their input on whether they agree with our approach and also to discuss areas where i think an additional doorstep review may be helpful i know you are working on the doorstep process with mike jordan but i would be grateful if you could ensure that the increased communication happens in the future thanksmichael enron capital trade resources corp from sally beck to michael r brownlonectectcc mike jordanlonectect fernley dysonlonectect ted murphylonectect subject doorstep review processdoorstep reviews are by design a quick look at commercial activities and the mid and back office support for those activities in our wholesale businesses ebs and ees will be included in the controls around mid and back office activities are best understood by conducting a deal test ie following the process and documentation around a series of transactions from the inception of a deal through the collection of cash asking someone to explain their processes and controls is more the act of explaining what we think happens doing a deal test tells us what does happen and it is when there are differences between the controls that we believe to be in place and what actually happens that we identify where operational and perhaps financial risk is created these reviews are not designed to replace the internal audit work for which enron has contracted with arthur andersen as such they are purposely designed to be conducted in a shorter timeframe than aas reviews and to produce less paperwork it is both the quick assessment of control gaps and potential operational risk and the quick solutions to correct these that are valuable in these reviews these reviews also look for ways to leverage success stories from one office to another in terms of best in class practices or practical solutions to shared problems briefly the doorstep review process would follow this set of steps crossfunctional doorstep review team arrives at subject office this is usually unannounced but key personnel in the subject office may be notified of the review a few days prior to the teams arrival to be certain that key individuals in that office will be not be out of town doorstep team lead will meet with the head of the subject office to tell them about the parameters of the review and to ask their cooperation in making information and personnel available to complete the review the review is conducted including information sessions with key commercial personnel to understand the business conducted in the office and key controloperations personnel to understand the business processes the deal test is conducted on a relevant sample of deals to verify the process and controls that were followed in the life of the transactions the doorstep team usually has a rough draft of key points by the end of the review which includes both controls that are working well and those which may not be working as designed potential action items are suggested this information is reviewed with the head of the office as they are usually very interested in knowing what can be done to improve controls to support their business there are times when the head of an office will suggest an additional point to be added to the list of action items knowing that with this focus heshe can get help in accomplishing certain efforts to support the growth of their business the doorstep team lets the head of the office know to whom this information will be communicated and the timing for doing so starting late in the findings from doorstep reviews would next be reviewed with ted murphy and me teds viewpoint would be from risk controls and mine from the mid and back office operations point of view ted and i assisted by cassandra schultz and shona wilson would work with appropriate personnel in the subject offices to understand who would assume responsibility for addressing action items noted from the doorstep review and to determine the appropriate time period for completing these action items then on a quarterly basis ted and i would meet with rick buy and rick causey to give them a recap of doorstep reviews completed during that quarter doorstep findings that had been handled updates on any outstanding doorstep findings and plans for the next quarter through most of the doorstep teams met with rick and rick within a few days of returning from each doorstep review this immediate feedback step was passed to ted and me sometime late in we did agree that we would meet with rick and rick before the quarterly review if certain doorstep findings were of particular concern or if we felt that they needed to be informed on an issue in a more timely manner than quarterly steps through were followed in the review of the scrap metals business in germany shona did conduct a debriefing session with the managing directors in charge of the scrap metal business her impression was that they were not concerned over the length of time that it was taking to implement the integration plan nor over the somewhat irregular payment methods that were discovered during the deal test that are not in keeping with enrons practices shona also debriefed with mike jordan and i believe that fernley was involved in that session as well at my suggestion she also contacted joe gold to inform him of her findings i do not know what the timing was for joe to get back to shona relative to rick buys email message michael i understand that you may have felt blindsided by the email from rick buy on his concerns over the scrap metal business and if that was the case i apologize for that while shona did debrief with mike and fernley i know that she did not review the teams findings directly with you if you would like to be included in a direct debriefing with the doorstep team when they review businesses that are managed by eel we can certainly add that as a clear step from this point going forward the out of the ordinary step in this doorstep review was shonas call to rick buy and rick causey to alert them to the doorstep teams concerns over irregular payment methods and the level of interest in controls that she perceived from the commercial managing directors i attribute that to a miscommunication between shona and myself although we had changed the process at year end so that the download after doorstep was to be with ted and me as shona and i voice mailed back and forth she thought that i had asked that she initiate a meeting with rick and rick this meeting should have been with ted and me in leaving a voice mail for the two ricks about setting up a meeting shona mentioned some concerns rick buy is the one that called her back and asked for more detail she definitely covered both the teams findings and the integration plan that was underway with rick buy we dont however control which points rick chooses to focus on or those to which he chooses to react to reiterate the findings from these doorstep reviews are shared with the heads of the subject offices at the close of the reviews the effort here is to help identify control issues that could create risk to a business and to offer solutions and resources that may be available from across the entire enron organization the key is quick discovery and quick resolution the findings create a dialogue between the business units rac and operations which i believe is healthy we purposefully have chosen not to overwordsmith the findings or to delay discussing concerns that can be surfaced through these reviews frankly i believe that these reviews can reveal things that are sometimes missed in aas reviews from a practical perspective and afford us the opportunity to mitigate operational risk i would be glad to discuss any details of the doorstep review process with you we certainly want you to be informed and to view this process as valuable input for you in managing eels business mike jordan and certain members of his team will be involved with doorstep reviews for other businesses outside eel later in the year we are certainly open to any suggestions you may have on getting the most out of this process

would suggest that you contact paul directly if you wish to discuss specific areas or inventory controls in general funding of inventorywe have a structured finance facility here in london the deal is specific to enron metals markets in that it works by reference to lme prices as these are the base index for all the positions placed in the facility if structured financing is sort for eim then it would be appropriate to talk to either david tregar metals commercial or bill appleby global finance as an intro to the issues faced curve management processthe markets in which our merchanting division trades are based on the lme curves but are linked to a large number of basis curves for quality and location given the vast number we have opted to break down the markets by brand group and port location eg for copper this means we have a grid with brand groups and sets of port groups for europe for the us and for the far east the maintaince price testing of the grids is made manageable by the fact the premiums only need be entered for brand and port groups by the traders yet prices can be tested by reference to node points ie price of specific brand at a given location which can be checked to a market quote re recruitment of paper tradersi havent been able to contact him but i recall that the brother of david rosenblum one of the metals traders in chicago is a trader of recylced

steve w younglonectect ted murphyhouectect sally beckhouectect subject re uk gas late deal input and deal booking errors om hit sorry to hear about this one i have some observations to make from my reading and rereading of the account it looks like the old undue influence problem again it seems some attempts were made by operations to follow up but nothing happened we tell our operations staff they have an obligation to dissent but we dont have any way to protect them if they do there is still the fear that if they upset a trader they can get fired or held back in their career and that is because twice a year at the prc that can happen this incident shows some of these attributesfor the operations process to be effective there has to be and be seen to be little significant influence from commercial groups over the ranking of the operations staff whoever signed off the new deal lists in the dpr should be asked to confirm the basis on which they signed it why wait for the traders to approve payments to brokers brokerage is in the pl and if operations are satisfied the trades are accurate and brokerage is at the agreed rate they should simply pay the brokerage two weeks to check telephone tapes is unacceptable it should be done same day i would not have waited for the traders to do it but i would want to know why it took them so long given that these short trades were absent from the portfolio during a highly volatile period of rising prices i would wonder about motivation in addressing the position during this time essentially if it had been correct we would have

europe ::::::>>>>>> re uk gas late deal input and deal booking errors om hit sorry to hear about this one i have some observations to make from my reading and rereading of the account it looks like the old undue influence problem again it seems some attempts were made by operations to follow up but nothing happened we tell our operations staff they have an obligation to dissent but we dont have any way to protect them if they do there is still the fear that if they upset a trader they can get fired or held back in their career and that is because twice a year at the prc that can happen this incident shows some of these attributesfor the operations process to be effective there has to be and be seen to be little significant influence from commercial groups over the ranking of the operations staff whoever signed off the new deal lists in the dpr should be asked to confirm the basis on which they signed it why wait for the traders to approve payments to brokers brokerage is in the pl and if operations are satisfied the trades are accurate and brokerage is at the agreed rate they should simply pay the brokerage two weeks to check telephone tapes is unacceptable it should be done same day i would not have waited for the traders to do it but i would want to know why it took them so long given that these short trades were absent from the portfolio during a highly volatile period of rising prices i would wonder about motivation in addressing the position during this time essentially if it had been correct we would have been reporting losses bigger than the ones we didi

you posted forwarded by fernley dysonlonect on james new to ted murphyhouectect david portmarket riskcorpenronenroncc mike jordanlonectect coralie evanslonectect fernley dysonlonectect subject status update on the issues surrounding continental power volatilities and correlationsas you know for some time we have been trying to get the continental power traders to increase the volatilities they use for valuing their option portfolio and for use in calculating their var as it has been obvious that the market has become more volatile but this was not being reflected in their markin looking at the impacts of this various other issues came to light firstly it raised issues over the correlation matrix used in the var model as this was way out of date we have worked with jitendra and have now put in a matrix that both the traders risk and rac are happy with secondly as you may be aware in portcalc swaptions currently use the volatility input on the deal ticket and not off any volatility curve the current portfolio is swaptions and so this represents a serious issue for us in that it is not practical to manually change all the volatilities at the deal ticket level every time the implied voaltilities change we cannot use the option functionality as this only values hourly or daily exercise options and not fixed expiry swaptions or options we also have not found any way in portcalc of valuing asian options so we are having to force in the few we have we have had the houston based portcalc it team work on a new piece of swaption valuation code but currently it contains a number of worrying bugs these are primarily that the proposed code does not take the correct underlying forward price and uses the volatility of approximating the last day of the underlying rather than the implied volatility of the underlying they are currently being hampered in that they do not have any it personnel who have sufficient option knowledge i understand that the two most experienced coders resigned to go to another houston based energy company this is extremely worrying and i find it hard to believe that the whole of enrons power business is having to use the methodology of inputting the volatility at the deal ticket level this will almost certainly mean that different volatilities are being used in the var as are being used to value the swaption portfolio globally as well as these issues we have concerns over the use and accuracy of the smile adjustment in portcalc worryingly it does not seem that you can switch this off briefly it seems that portcalc calculates the delta used to adjust the volatility by comparing the strike price to the forward price of the last day of the underlying rather than the forward price of the underlying itself we have engaged london based it and are looking at the code we have used in power to se if there is a way we can get something done quickly to start to value all option products off a curve and to be able to book asian optionsonce we get the above resolved we still have no way or extracting the vega or gamma risk from portcalc in its current state as the information is just no there so we are told by it the system seems we cannot be sure given all the other errors to produce a vega and gamma pl number but what the risk is remains a mystery again this is very worrying in that we have power option traders all over the world who cant get their underlying vega or gamma risk position from the global valuation system we are trying to work on something manual to draw a line in the sand but i would really like to know how the american based traders cope as they have this problem knowingly or not for years what sign offs were gained for the implementation of enpower because it seems to us that using the current system it is not possible to comply with the global risk policy how do we validate the inputs to the valuation if we do not know the risk despite the above we have now persuaded the traders to save out newer higher volatilities a week ago and you should have seen a large move up in their var however as it stands at the moment they are notable to save out a daily remark as jitendra is saying that he is not happy with their model vol curve generator i have today asked for a full explanation details of any testing etc etc and time lines so we can move to getting over this hurdle the swaptions have also not yet had the ticket volatility changed but the impacts are expected to be positive as we are long volatilityi would appreciate your comments on the above as it seems that we are pushing the boundaries here on areas which we really expect to have already been covered in houston some time ago and could do with some help we are having to use a system which seems to us to have numerous bugs and short comings and are having to spend an enormous amount of it time overcoming the inadequacies of enpower wich i do not think most people are aware of consequently we have not been able to deliver all the improvements we were required to do in gaining the increased limits so months ago but i would hope you agree that it is not for a lack of tryingsorry its so long but if there are any questions or any perceived inaccuracies in any of the above then please let me knowjames

europe ::::::>>>>>> rac issues i would welcome the opportunity to discuss this with you both probably separately given our diaries i am keen to understand whether we have the same perceptions of the control process and of the timetable for moving forward to our shared vision i will try to call later todaymike forwarded by mike jordanlonect on mike jordan to fernley dysonlonectectcc steve w younglonectect james newlonectect david hardylonectect subject rac issuesfernleyoutput from a meeting with david and james on the specific issues davids view is that a detailed factual list of issues is as yet not available but the summary is as follows at present europe is substantially hitting the two key deadlines of officialisation of the books by risk management by am houston time and summary dpr received in houston by noon indeed have internal deadlines hour before that for contingency however there are some it problems in that the feeds to houston post officialisation are currently taking a number of hours and it are currently looking to rewriting feeds and purchasing a dedicated server for feeding to risktracadditionally because of the time difference between the two targets and the fact that risk managament do not obtain mtm information until completion of the overnight batch ie start working first thing in morning uk time there has been scope for continuing to work on the raw mtm data consequentlythere is potential for risk management top siding for corrections such that the summary dpr will be different from the risktrac information we do topsides because it is impossible given current systems to rerun the overnight batch and extract the data from the valuation systems our pl explain processes are themselves spreadsheet basedthe majority of topsides are caused by inaccurate data capture at the deal entry stage itself a symptom of underinvestment in the data validation process of risk systemswhilst the topside adjustment is communicated to houston risktrac requires a fully automated processwhilst we should consider the materiality of the topside rac rightly are trying to implement zero tolerance to help flag all the issueswithin the last fortnight we once received the incorrect curves on uk power such that the full database was incorrectly valued there was insufficient time for reason stated above to rerun and reextract and indeed today the batch failed because the uk power server ran out of processing diskspacewe are doing a reasonably good job given the significant systems inadequacies we face and that have been flagged on a continuous basis they are on the long list for development the recent daily taskforce meetings will provide more structured reporting of the root causes that will allow better escalation of systemic issues and we should seek to discuss these in the context of the goal of corporate policy compliance we should recommunicate the policy internally within europe

europe ::::::>>>>>> re a note being sent out under john sherriffs name your thoughts on the cover note sallyi think the idea of finding an efficient way to reference this effort as an enronwide initiative to define and monitor these standards across all locations and all commodities traded is great and i would hope to reference it via the reporting process that shona is trying to roll outi will work with shona who undoubtedly would want to send out in your name the global notification of our aims mike enron capital trade resources corp from sally beck to mike jordanlonectectcc subject re a note being sent out under john sherriffs name your thoughts on the cover note i read your note back to shona and i understand johns desire to put a reminder in front of people including commerical staff members about the need for operating standards if this is the best time to put that in writing for europe then by all means go forward with that if there is an efficient way to reference this effort as an enronwide initiative to define and monitor these standards across all locations and all commodities traded then that would be great it simply helps put the london initiative in the context of an enronwide effort that we all feel is important sally mike jordan amto sally beckhouectectcc fernley dysonlonectect subject re a note being sent out under john sherriffs name your thoughts on the cover note comments in red enron capital trade resources corp from sally beck to mike jordanlonectectcc fernley dysonlonectect subject re a note being sent out under john sherriffs name your thoughts on the cover note i think that it is a great idea to get some press regarding our fundamental operating standards but i wonder about the most appropriate timing enough of a global message it is a european note and the means of delivery on the means of delivery i am not sure from your note whether or not i fully understand the intent is there an article to be included in an enron publication yes and in addition a letter to be sent under johns name if so to whom will the letter be sent or is the letter from john an introduction to be included as a lead in to the article yes apologies if there is confusion with regard to a global message i think that one of the key points around fundamental operating standards are that they are intended to be global in nature applied to every commodity and every location where we engage in trading activities with these operating standards implemented worldwide we will know as operations professionals that risk is being mitigated and we will be able to ensure enron top management that there is consistency in operating standards worldwide these global standards also should enable enron to expand its business reach more quickly with well defined requirements with regard to trading operations i am not sure from the article as written that the global nature of this effort comes across agreed but the note was targeted at europe would welcome the opportunity to work on this with you and shona finally a question regarding timing the last i knew after you and brent drafted this starting point for fundamental operating standards was that this was being circulated shona took this to do after brents return to houston for comments to all business controllers i dont believe that we are quite at the point that we can say that all business controllers worldwide have reviewed understand and have implemented these standards and not to belittle the process of creating the standards the tough part and the real meat behind this will be an effective exception report on a global basis against these standards my commitment to rick causey is that i will have that global report in production by the end of the year there is much work to do in defining the content and regularity of the report and even more work to do to identify reliable sources of data for compiling the report shona has commissioned mike moscoso to work on this and i believe that mike has already been working with james new so i question whether or not you want to publish info about fundamental standards that we can not yet report against would a more appropriate time be after the global operations controller meeting in october when we should have worldwide buyin and commitment to these standards and hopefully our first draft of a meaningful exception report can we discuss this please see separate note from me to shonasorry that this response looks so long i have been interrupted times while responding so i hope that it makes sense thanks for sharing this with me since you asked for input i hope that you dont mind that i gave you some sally certainly not and thanksmike jordan amto fernley dysonlonectect sally beckhouectectcc subject a note being sent out under john sherriffs name your thoughts on the cover note fernley sallyoff and on with jackie gentles help i have pulled together a one page communication

europe ::::::>>>>>> re a note being sent out under john sherriffs name your thoughts on the cover note comments in red enron capital trade resources corp from sally beck to mike jordanlonectectcc fernley dysonlonectect subject re a note being sent out under john sherriffs name your thoughts on the cover note i think that it is a great idea to get some press regarding our fundamental operating standards but i wonder about the most appropriate timing enough of a global message it is a european note and the means of delivery on the means of delivery i am not sure from your note whether or not i fully understand the intent is there an article to be included in an enron publication yes and in addition a letter to be sent under johns name if so to whom will the letter be sent or is the letter from john an introduction to be included as a lead in to the article yes apologies if there is confusion with regard to a global message i think that one of the key points around fundamental operating standards are that they are intended to be global in nature applied to every commodity and every location where we engage in trading activities with these operating standards implemented worldwide we will know as operations professionals that risk is being mitigated and we will be able to ensure enron top management that there is consistency in operating standards worldwide these global standards also should enable enron to expand its business reach more quickly with well defined requirements with regard to trading operations i am not sure from the article as written that the global nature of this effort comes across agreed but the note was targeted at europe would welcome the opportunity to work on this with you and shona finally a question regarding timing the last i knew after you and brent drafted this starting point for fundamental operating standards was that this was being circulated shona took this to do after brents return to houston for comments to all business controllers i dont believe that we are quite at the point that we can say that all business controllers worldwide have reviewed understand and have implemented these standards and not to belittle the process of creating the standards the tough part and the real meat behind this will be an effective exception report on a global basis against these standards my commitment to rick causey is that i will have that global report in production by the end of the year there is much work to do in defining the content and regularity of the report and even more work to do to identify reliable sources of data for compiling the report shona has commissioned mike moscoso to work on this and i believe that mike has already been working with james new so i question whether or not you want to publish info about fundamental standards that we can not yet report against would a more appropriate time be after the global operations controller meeting in october when we should have worldwide buyin and commitment to these standards and hopefully our first draft of a meaningful exception report can we discuss this please see separate note from me to shonasorry that this response looks so long i have been interrupted times while responding so i hope that it makes sense thanks for sharing this with me since you asked for input i hope that you dont mind that i gave you some sally certainly not and thanksmike jordan amto fernley dysonlonectect sally beckhouectectcc subject a note being sent out under john sherriffs name your thoughts on the cover note fernley sallyoff and on with jackie gentles help i have pulled together a one page communication note on our fundamental operating standards itself a one page summary we are in the final stages of this process where we draft a cover letter for john which will introduce this for inclusion within globalflash the enron europe newsletter have you any thoughts on draft or cover note mike

japan ::::::>>>>>> attitudes about foreigners that some japanese hold because of unique aspects of their language and culture the japanese generally find it far easier to deal with each other than with foreingers in some japanese this unease can lead to some unappealing attitudes and behaviorsthe japanese maintain a very clear distinction between an individuals public and private faces so that it is rare to catch them expressing hostile views of foreigners nevertheless every now and then a politicians remarks will land him in trouble you might find the enclosed article interesting by the way ishihara spent two weeks denying that he had done anything wrong and only apologized in the past couple of daysregardseugenio ishihara acknowledges word was inappropriate yomiuri shimbun tokyo gov shintaro ishihara late wednesday acknowledged in a statement that it was inappropriate for him to have used the word sangokujin and said that he regrets having caused misunderstanding and hurting foreigners in general by using the derogatory term in a recent speech it was the first time that ishihara had clearly admitted to having hurt foreign residents by using the word which has discriminatory connotations sangokujin literally means people from third countries yet it was used after world war ii as a derisory term for people from former japanese colonies primarily koreans living in japan on april he told members of the ground selfdefense forces in tokyo at a ceremony atrocious crimes have been committed repeatedly by sangokujin and other foreigners who have illegally entered japan it is to be expected that they will riot in the event of a major disaster although he used the word to refer to those who have illegally entered the country it had a different meaning from what he meant to say he said i did not intend to hurt korean or other foreign residents in japan and i am extremely regretful ishihara said in the statement promising that he would never again use the inappropriate word which is prone to cause misunderstanding on april he expressed regret over his remarks but stopped short of acknowledging the derogatory import of the word sangokujin and failed to apologize for having hurt the feelings of foreigners wednesdays statement was made in response to demands from metropolitan assembly members of minshuto democratic party of japan asking that he retract his remarks and make a public apology ishihara handed the statement to senior minshuto members of the assembly after they held a meeting earlier in the day the statement to which ishihara will affix the governors official seal will become an official document hidejiro kawai secretary general of the minshuto group within the assembly said an official document carries weight which will be tantamount to the governors withdrawal of his remarks and apology indicating that the group will not take the matter further

mg ::::::>>>>>> re mg integration resource requirements dear mikea lot of the needs listed in tims memo will also be needed in ny but on a smaller scale ill put a resource requirement memo together by the end of the week and then we can determine who would fit these requirements and where these people should come from londonhoustoni think this project would be a great opportunity for some analystsassociates of course working under experienced personnelregardsshona mike jordanect amto tim poullainpattersonlonectectcc richard sagelonectect fernley dysonlonectect andrew cornfieldlonectect shona wilsonnaenronenron subject re mg integration resource requirements a good tee up and one we should regularly reassess here goes some initial feedback which you should push back on valuation review resource requirement to be defined in detail by andy in his new role i think the offer from eric of finding some analysts and associates for the short term assessment may be the immediate answerbalance sheet substantiation at present i assess the power and gas substantiation process as priority although we should review the resources coming free from global chris and rashpal as they may not be easily useable by raewyn chris is free at present and rashpal promised for thunderball whilst i am as concerned as you are we should reassess level of risk becauseaa would have done could do more some substantive due diligence on balance sheetthe trade accountants at mg had a simplistic entity structure based around an infrastructure where the as did both the dpr and account posting unlike our own systems so inherent risk is lower excluding inventory we must make certain our efforts are aligned to fin ops inventory interesting one this it should be very accurately controlled already it is the business yet the problem is that it is not transparent at the consolidation level i would like you to get david tregar to assess the level of risk with you and discuss with me and philip lord the current securitisation of inventory before we put an action plan in place for this balance sheet categoryintegration controls you should continue your efforts to bring the mg priority to the functional stripe leaders agenda after fridays meeting they know the effort required are that recruitment is keysap we will look to michael heap on this but we did identify some key business analysis work for kevin rhodes to be done asap we should track this remote offices continues to be the dog that has not barked yet richard you and i need to rethink where we are particularly with south americaoverall we both agree more resources are required but they have to be scoped quite precisely thanks for the notetim poullainpatterson to mike jordanlonectectcc subject mg integration resource requirementsmikeas you know we still have a very full issues list and we are spreading the few resources we have on ground pretty thinly leaving a residue of partially completed tasks that will need to be revisited at some point also though we are leveraging mg staff where we can we have already made an assessment that their support infrastructure is very lean this is being stretched to breaking point by the rw acquisition and various enron integration initiatives eg establishing functional teamsat present we have the following resources on the groundwe are continuing to identify issues that add to our assessment of operational risk if we are to reduce this risk to an acceptable level we need to commit additional resources to the project i assess our current resource needs as followsvaluation review the valuation review that andy and i performed prior to effective control date identified a number of complex valuation issues that require further quantitative analysis also there is imbedded optionality in a lot of the physical business transacted throughout mg which should be modelled to determine the correct valuation and accounting treatment and if there is any extra value to be extracted eric gadd has recently prioritised this requirement risk manager with developed quantitativemodelling skillsbalance sheet substantiation a comprehensive validation of balances including a review of reconciliations evidence of account ownership detection of s accounts etc is overdue requirement lead accountant plus two juniorsinventory a lot more analysis is required of the global inventory balances see earlier note to eric gadd requirement onetwo risk managersgeneral integration having now identified the functional leads for mg in london we are now due to involve the stripe leaders in the process of creating the functional groups including identifying gaps in resourcing i will not prejudge the outcome beyond saying that each functional group will need extra staff that i am expecting the stripe leaders to provide requirement to be determined by stripe leaderssap requirement to be determined by sap project teamremote offices the above requests relate to the london office only having identified enron controllers for the offices in the far east i do not envisage significant issues integrating those offices however i have minimal understanding of what our requirements in the us and south america are and propose deferring that discussion to another timeregardstim

emetra intends to establish a worldwide businesstobusiness ecommerce trading platform for the nonferrous metal s markets including physical trading and the trading of futures and options contracts why is enron acquiring mg enron is committed to expanding its position as a global leader in wholesal e markets by expanding into new wholesale markets such as nonferrous metal s enron expects to leverage its wholesale expertise and will be able to offer customers new products and solutions to address their business needs which link different commodities and inputs mg will provide enron with a number of important benefits at the same tim e enron expects that mg will significantly benefit from its association with enron some of the benefits we envisage include the opportunity to combine enrons core competencies in trading finan ce and origination with mgs global position in trading nonferrous metals the ability for both enron and mg to access new clients particularly in the united states and europe the ability to crossmarket both existing products and new products such as bundled products that offer combined metals and power outsourcing the ability to leverage the opportunities available to mg by increasing i ts financial strength and the resources available to it the chance to overlay the enrononline businessmodel on the metals indust ry to increase liquidity and contract market share what remains to be done merging the business operations of two entities even highly motivated companies such as enron and mg has been and will continue to be a formidab le and daunting exercise having a shared vision facilitates rapid integratio n but there are many complicated and complex tasks that remain during the conditional offer period enron and mg are taking steps to prepare for a seamless and nondisruptive integration of our respective operations ideally when enrons offer to buy all mg shares becomes unconditional july is the current target date the two can hit the ground with thei r feet running in the short term a number of things must be accomplished to facilitate th at smooth transition most importantly in order to ensure that the deal goes forward enron and mg will work to remove the remaining conditions to enron s offer including obtaining the shareholder approvals from all shareholders as well as obtaining relevant regulatory consents a number of other steps must be taken however during the first phase of o ur integration timetable to ensure that everything stays on track integratio n activities will focus on four primary aspects of our operations commercial matters financial matters middle and back office issues and most importantly on the employees of both organisations some of the most important goals relating to each of these areas are commercial developing physical metal contracts suitable for listing on enrononline a nd installing necessary communication and technology links to facilitate data transfers and information flows between mg and enron preparing a joint venture management plan for mgs interest in emetra tha t is consistent with enrons goal of listing physical metal contracts on enrononline identifying opportunities to combine enrons core competencies in trading finance and origination wi th mgs global position in trading nonferrous metals leverage mgs position by increasing its financial strength and resour ces available to it crossmarket both existing and new products to enron and mg customers particularly in the us and europe and grow mgs metal trading franchise financial obtaining waivers

one of those abdoer machines dear diary for my fiftieth birthday this year my husband the dear purchased a week of personal training at the local health club for me although i am still in great shape since playing on my high school softball team i decided it would be a good idea to go ahead and give it a try i called the club and made my reservations with a personal trainer ill call bruce who identified himself as a yearold aerobics instructor and model for clothing and swimwear my husband seemed pleased with my enthusiasm to get started the club encouraged me to keep a diary to chart my progress monday started my day at am tough to get out of bed but found it was well worth it when i arrived at the health club to find bruce waiting for me he is something of a greek god with blond hair dancing eyes and a dazzling white smile woo hoo bruce gave me a tour and showed me the machines he took my pulse after five minutes on the treadmill he was alarmed that my pulse was so fast but i attribute it to standing next to him in his lycra aerobic outfit i enjoyed watching the skillful way in which he conducted his aerobics class after my workout today very inspiring bruce was encouraging as i did my situps although my gut was already aching from holding it in the whole time he was around this is going to be a fantastic week tuesday i drank a whole pot of coffee but i finally made it out the door bruce made me lie on my back and push a heavy iron bar into the air then he put weights on it my legs were a little wobbly on the treadmill but i made the full mile bruces rewarding smile made it all worthwhile i feel great its a whole new life for me wednesday the only way i can brush my teeth is by laying on the toothbrush on the counter and moving my mouth back and forth over it i believe i have a hernia in both pectorals driving was okay as long as i didnt try to steer or stop i parked on top of a geo in the club parking lot bruce was impatient with me insisting that my screams bothered other club members his voice is a little too perky for early in the morning and when he scolds he gets this nasally whine that is very annoying my chest hurt when i got on the treadmill so bruce put me on the stair monster why the hell would anyone invent a machine to simulate an activity rendered obsolete by elevators bruce told me it would help me get in shape and enjoy life he said some other shit too thursday bruce was waiting for me with his vampirelike teeth exposed as his thin cruel lips were pulled back into a full snarl i couldnt help being a half an hour late it took me that long to tie my shoes bruce took me to work out with dumbbells when he was not looking i ran and hid in the mens room he sent lars to find me then as punishment put me on the rowing machine which i sank friday i hate that bastard bruce more than any human being has ever hated any other human being in the history of the world stupid skinny anemic little cheerleader wannabe bastard if there were a part of my body i could move without unbearable pain i would beat him with it bruce wanted me to work on my triceps i dont have any triceps and if you dont want dents in the floor dont hand me the barbells or anything that weighs more than a sandwich which i am sure you learned in the sadist school you attended and graduated magna cum laude from bruce you nazi bastard the treadmill flung me off and i landed on a health and nutrition teacher why couldnt it have been someone softer like the drama coach or the choir director saturday bruce left a message on my answering machine in his grating shrilly voice wondering why i did not show up today just hearing him made me want to smash the machine with my planner however i lacked the strength even to use the tv remote and ended up catching eleven straight hours of the weather channel sunday im having the church van pick me up for services today so i can go and thank god that this week is over i will also pray that next year my husband the bastard will choose a gift for me that is fun like a root canal or a hysterectomy suzanne cox tenor networks s syracuse way suite greenwood village co fax do you yahooyahoo

to explain the recruiting strategy since i was instrumental in helping to set it you are absolutely correct it is great to do market research if time permits or it is regarding an issue of which we have little knowledge as you are aware over the past year we have engaged a professional recruiting firm brecker merryman who has assisted us in a number of different mark et research projects however in my opinion this issue is not one that required much research i have been involved in recruiting in some way shape or form at both the graduate and undergraduate level for the past years most major organizations with the exception of the accounting firm s begin the summer intern recruiting process in early spring there are actually some universities that do not allow recruitment of summer interns until after a certain date particularly in the mba programs for example harvard does not allow an organization to come on campus and speak to first year students until january as indicated the firms that generally recrui t in the fall are the accounting firms and they are primarily recruiting for spring internships the recruiting strategy at enron is no different this year than it was last year with respect to summer interns presentations were made in january february and offers were made in february and march the only school that did not follow the normal process was ou under the direction of george hope we did of course recruit summer interns in the fall for the tax group because they are competing directly with the accounting firms utilizing this strategy did not impair enrons ability to hire quality s ummer interns this past summer enron had summer analysts undergraduate and summer associates graduate we intentionally limited the number of summer hires to ensure that the individuals hired received meaningful assignments approximately of these individuals received permanent offers to join enron the reason enron has not had a problem recruiting quality undergraduate summer interns is primarily because many organizations do not hire undergraduates for summer positions they generally focus on mbas particularly the investment banks and consulting firms which are the firms that jeff skilling identifies as enrons competitors because the undergraduates are not actively recruited by our competition we have continued to have a special focus on these individuals ie the reason the re were undergraduates and only mbas with respect to ou and ut specifically since those were the schools about which you raised a concern let me address your concerns in your email y ou indicated that you had research conducted at ut and ou you did not howeve r provide the results of the research or the person to whom they had spoken therefore i had lexi elliott contact both ut and ou while ou has not gotten back to her following is the information obtained from ut o the contact at ut career services is cindy henson o according to cindy approximately of companies actively recruiting on campus conduct interviews in the fall for summer internships cindy attributes this to the fact that these companies cannot come in the spring or in the case of andersen consulting have a tremendous need and conduct all interviews at one time o in conclusion cindy estimated that of companies actively recruiting on campus recruit in the spring for summer internships we have not received information from ou therefore i am unable to provide t he statistics at this time i will provide as soon as i am in receipt of such information it appears that the information your source obtained is considerably different than what we were told if you would provide the name of the individual to whom they spoke i will follow up to determine the reason for the discrepancies while i understand your concern with respect to ou they appear to be different than most of the other schools at which we recruit if you belie ve that it is critical to recruit summer interns at ou in the fall we are supportive however because lexi has other school interviews that are already scheduled she will not be in a position to facilitate the interview process during the trip you have scheduled currently as you are aware in most instances the dates for presentations and interviews are dictated by the respective universities and were secured in early august if you would like for her to try and secure an interview schedule for a later date this fall she can certainly work with your schedule and her current schedule to support your efforts i hope this has been helpful i can understand and appreciate your frustration if you are not getting answers from the recruiter or her manager again i offer that i am available and willing to work with you i f you are having difficulty with members of the program staff please let me know what you decide about recruiting this fall for summer interns and whether i can be of any additional assistance charlene

recruiting ::::::>>>>>> re hiring practices for summer interns sallythanks for the email and update i agree that we must do something quickly to resolve this i believe that you should interview for summer interns as an extension to your upcoming planned recruiting trip i know you were very happy with the summer interns from the energy management program at ou that you got last year i was surprised and the school was thrilled that you offered all permanent positions upon graduation we cant lose that momentum i am sure that each schools program is different and that most dont interview for summer interns this early in the year but from what i have learned about the ou schedule we will lose all the top candidates if we wait i am sure that is not what charlene and celeste were trying to accomplish with their guidelinesplease keep me up informed on this matterthanks and good luck with the studentsmike enron north america corp from sally beck pm to charlene jacksoncorpenronenron celeste robertshouectectcc richard causeycorpenronenron mike mcconnellhouectect subject hiring practices for summer internswhile recruiting on campus recently i became aware that a decision was made at the program level to not interview this fall for summer interns in talking with students and faculty at the university of texas and university of oklahoma it became clear that there is concern over the feasibility of an internship with enron as other top firms will be recruiting this fall for summer interns i have communicated my concerns to lexi elliott and her manager shelley jones and was told by both that the decision to delay interviews for summer interns was made at a program level based on enrons staffing when i asked about the competitive data available regarding the practice of other firms on summer intern interviews i was even more concerned to discover that neither lexi nor shelley had that data it would seem critical to know what the competition is doing in terms of summer intern interview schedules in order to understand the risk that could be created for enron by not interviewing this fall for these important feeder positions for our analyst and associates programs i have had conversations over the last two weeks with lexi and shelley with no resolution when they could not provide the competitive data to either confirm or eliminate my concerns i volunteered to have james scribner a senior director on my team obtain this market information lexi and shelley either did not have the time to gather this data or were not sure how to do so they were pleased to have some help in getting our hands on this critical information i now have information at hand with regard to firms that will be recruiting at ut and ou this fall for summer intern positions and based on this information i believe that enron is at risk for not hiring top students as interns for the summer of if we do not interview for these positions this fall while my research only touches on two of the schools at which enron recruits i want to raise concern over this as a potential problem at many if not all campuses that we have targeted for recruiting as administrators of the program you rely on the involvement of senior members of the company to carry the enron message to campus i believe that we also have an obligation to make this a twoway messaging system i strongly believe that we must address this potential risk for enron extremely quickly as teams will be on campuses across the country to conduct interviews in a matter of days i suspect that many enron participants in the recruiting process are unaware of the programs decision regarding the timing of interviews for summer internships in working with rick causey and mike mcconnell executive sponsors for ut and ou respectively they are as concerned as i about the decision on interviewing summer interns i have copied both of them on this note to the two of you please let me know how this can be resolved with the help of james scribner and others we have already compiled a list of students at ut and ou that should be targeted for summer internships i will offer as much of my time as is feasible to work with staff members of the program to devise creative ways to turn this around

recruiting ::::::>>>>>> ou recruiting sallyover the past year or so enron has made a great impact at the university of oklahoma in a very short time we have become one of the employers ofof choice within the college of business we have been able to do this by paying attention to details and going beyond the necessary we have formedgreat relationships and planted seeds that will reap benefits for years to come if we do not become complacent i for one am an example of the impressionthat enron has forged at ou i am here because i believe that enron represents one of the greatest opportunities in not only the energy industry but the but the business world in generali am sending this note because i believe we are taking steps that will lessen our momentum at the university of oklahoma i have learned that we willnot be sponsoring any entertainment for our presentation this fall as you know last year we sponsored a hypnotist and a drama team for entertainment after our presentations being a student at the time i felt this was a great idea and i know that my fellow students enjoyed the presentations as well they felt that it was a great opportunity to gain insight from enron representatives as well enjoy the entertainment which we provided as i understand the aa program now takes the position that this does not provide any residual value for enron and does not warrant the expense i do not understand this reasoning and feel that there is great value in such an arrangement it places another selling point on our presentation and gives us a better opportunity to familiarize ourselves with upcoming talent this may seem like an insignificant detail but i hope we will see the value that this opportunity presents the students of the em program and the jc penney leadership program are expecting another exciting evening from enron and hate to see us fall short of these expectations it is very likely that if we do not sponsor this event one of our competitors will the competition for talent is growing and we can not allow ourselves to become overconfident in our recruiting efforts enron is a great place to work and we must take that image to campus i know that mr mcconnell is a very exciting speaker and will no doubt amaze those present that is why we should take this simple step to have as many potential leaders present as possible and continue our path to recruiting dominance at the university of oklahomai am fully aware that you were the instrumental element in putting ou within enrons sights your involvement at ou is greatly appreciated and i hope you maintainyour interest in the university of oklahoma please consider my views on this matter and express any concerns of your own to the analyst and associate programthank youjody crook

sap ::::::>>>>>> sap ar ap aging report tonight kris and i met with the sap team about the critical issues we discussed in the meeting this morning as far as xref coordinator and xref physical vs financial flag fields go it appears that we are getting what we have to have in order to go live rena was working on a spec the oss that was discussed that would automatically populate these fields however the test was unsuccessful these two fields are being opened up for netting so we can input them manually when netting i believe we need to pursue the auto fill post but the first priority is having a place to put the dataas far as settlement period is concerned we are probably going to get a hybrid of what we want at this time the sap team does appear to have appropriate resources working on this issue for data created in sap i am more comfortable that the data is being captured on the income statement side of the entry and the sap folks now seem to think they can link over to it to get the settlement data for data converted we will not be able to get the settlement period in the same manner the offsetting entry in conversion is to a dummy conversion account rather than an income statement account the dummy account doesnt carry the settlement date another issue is related to the indicator to let us know if an invoice has had cash applied or

sap ::::::>>>>>> ena sap project as you know we have substantially wrapped up our work related to this project today we are making what i hope are final changes to the maps and deliverables with the anticipation that we will deliver to you complete binders by wednesday one issue that we wanted to communicate relates to the use of manual payment processes and the risk that processing manual payments presents in the automated unifysap environment this issue was raised by melissa during our discussion of the manual cash reconciliation effort caused by the inability of sap to automatch cash receipts and disbursements in situations where the money has moved or been received but the corresponding je has not been made in sap both melissa and cindy morrow have been involved in subsequent discussions related to the belowmentioned risks risk of je and payment duplicationpayments taken directly to treasury and underlying transaction is recorded in unify in the event that the transaction giving rise to the manual payment is entered initially into unify which would be the case for all normal commodity payments excluding broker fee and broker margin payment transactions a risk exists that the payment could be recorded and paid twice once by either ap or treasury when the manual payment is wired and subsequently recorded and once during the normal unify to sap interface process controls will be put in place to mitigate this risk however all controls will be peoplebased not systembased it is too late to rebuild the unify to sap interface to better address the use of manual payments one additional suggestion might be to work with each group to reduce the use of manual payments except under welldefined important circumstancespayments taken to treasury and underlying transaction is recorded directly to sap does not go through unifyif the payment is not entered into sap with payment method j ap will not realize that the payment has already been made and will process the disbursement a second time risk of understated expensepayments taken to treasury and underlying transaction is recorded in unifyfor manual payments that are not finalized in unify a process performed in the system to mark an invoice as final by monthend but the disbursement has already happened expense will be understatedpayments taken to treasury and underlying transaction is recorded directly to sap does not go through unifyif payment is not input into sap by monthend but cash has moved expense will be understated cash outflow account will show a credit balance which will be flipped to ap but no income statement entry will be made at that time risk of cash misappropriationin addition to the above risks related to the use of manual payments we also believe that a risk exists related to the use of excelgenerated counterparty invoices and the lack of segregation between the person responsible for preparing these invoices and also for handlinghaving access to the related accounting records we believe that it may be possible for a settlements coordinator to change the bank routing instructions or bank account number on the excel invoice mailed to the counterparty and then manipulate the accounting records during the cash application process to either write off the account balance or to reflect the receivable as being paid while constantly moving cash application balances from one counterparty to another so that no one account balance ages past an acceptable range we have been unable to determine a set of control procedures that would mitigate this risk revision to counterparty banking detailswe are currently investigating the procedure performed by treasury when problems with bank account details cause payments to kickout of treasury workstation if the risk of misappropriation exists related to this procedure we will separately communicatethe above may be unclear if so we would be glad to sit down with you for minutes or so and clarify please let me know if you have any questions thank you for the opportunity to work on this project

a decision to use unify ar for cash application rather than sap ar we decided at the time that sap ar would be kept in sync with unify ar by the unifysap interface we believe that the business logic for that decision has changed and are now recommending that unify ar be permanently turned off and all ar functions be performed in sap i have briefly summarized the change in business situation belowtwo years ago todaynetting allowed by legal and credit only if netting contract was already in place netting encouraged by legal and credit wherever possible regardless of existence of signed agreementnetting limited to one counterparty and legal entity at a time canada nets across counterpartiesnetting performed in physical only financial settlements to maintain separate net statement process ena considering netting physical and financial togetherall account coordinators were to apply their own cash cash applied centrally in power financial and canada individual coordinators apply cash only in physical gascash was to be applied at the line item level to track variances and to facilitate calculation of cost of funds by commercial team although gas settlements is applying cash for some invoices at the line item level this functionality is not being used by power settlements and will not be used by financial settlements the company has not made any move towards calculating cost of funds by commercial teamthe account inquiry functionality in unify was thought to be a key online tool old habits die hardmost users appear to be printing reports and reviewing data rather than using the online functionalityoverapplication of cash was not to be allowed overpayments would be classified as on account with issues tracked in a case management system case management system does not exist allowing overapplication helps the account coordinators track overpayments easier than leaving cash on accountthe counterpartylegal entity combination on the deposit needed to match the counterpartylegal entity combination on the enron invoice given the number of legal entities enron has along with the number of entities our counterparties have this seems like a hopeless battle allowing crossapplication of cash seems easiercorp required that intercompany settlements had to be settled with cash movement corp no longer requires intercompany settlements to be settled with cash movementconverting to sap ar simplifies the unifysap interface in the following waysbank deposits into sap do not have to be split off into unifycash entries in unify do not have to be interfaced back to sapunify netting entries do not have to be interfaced to sappayables information does not have to be interfaced from sap to unifygiven the change in attitudes towards our netting business process we face two problems in unify controls built into unify are already obsoleteunify does not maintain all products in one database making efforts to net across products in the future physical with financial for instance impossibleour understanding of the netting process in sap indicates that there are no controls which sounds good at this point and that we would retain the automatic netting entries when the payable is netted with the receivable within sap however we emphasize that netting would be done in sap not at the time of finaling a payment in unifyto repeat we are recommending

sap ::::::>>>>>> re perry gas sap override issue the cause of this was the timing of when sap went down sap had a major system crash the day willie finaled his supply verification in unify before willie went into sap to net the payable same day sap crashed by the time sap came up the treasury run had already picked up the payable and wired the cash when we issued the recall the money was already out the dooras a result we put a policy in place that all supply verifications for netout customers must be overridden as soon as they are finaled in unify this causes them to be blocked in sap and not picked up by treasury until the payment block is removed this policy went into effect at the beginning of september however this still relies on human intervention to ensure the procedure works to ensure we dont accidentally release cash i have asked unify it to change the interface to send all purchases for ena to sap blocked which will require the coordinator to release funds this is an added step but is worth it considering the stakes this change will go into effect on monday if you have any questions please let me knowbryce enron north america corp from sally beck pm to bryce baxterhouectect leslie reeveshouectectcc subject re perry gas sap override issuei have read this series of emails but i am not sure that i fully understand the issue did willie not do his job are there problems with how sap works are both of these an issue please let me know if we have a far reaching problem with sap and netting thanks sally forwarded by sally beckhouect on pm from william s bradford pm to sally beckhouectectcc debbie r bracketthouectect subject re perry gas sap override issuesallyare you aware of the problems with sap this error caused an incremental credit loss to perry gas companies that could have been preventedlet me know if you have any questionsbill forwarded by william s bradfordhouect on pm from russell diamond pm to william s bradfordhouectect debbie r bracketthouectectcc subject re perry gas sap override issuefyi forwarded by russell diamondhouect on pm from bryce baxter pm to russell diamondhouectectcc subject re perry gas sap override issue russell as i remember willie finaled the supply verification and it was interfaced to sap this is fine and then willie was going to net the ap and ar sap went down after the statement was interfaced but before willie was able to block or net the payment when sap came back up the next day the payment had already gone out and we were unable to recall the wire if you have any further questions about this call me thanks from russell diamond pm to willie stewarthouectectcc audrey cookhouectect bryce baxterhouectect subject perry gas sap override issuewillieper our earlier conversation can you or audrey or bryce please give further explain to me as to why the funds were wired to perry gas for purchases from the counterparty instead on netting the amounts between purchases and sales you mentioned to me the process of overriding the counterpartys that net on sap although because of timing the override did not take placethank yourussell

sap ::::::>>>>>> august end of month close a summary debrief the august end of month close is behind us once again we learned some things we made progressbut we also have issues to work summary on improvements for this end of month closei would like to congratulate the users the application team and the dba team for a much improved end of month close for august gas this would not have been possible without the significant commitment focus and teamwork exhibited by all the folks involved in this effort the most tangible measure of progress over the july close we were able to keep all users in the system throughout the final week no one was kicked off the systemthe gas accounting close process finished on time key users and it folks didnt have to work significant overtime to finish the process improvements arose from upgrading the unify system to sybase with extra server memory this reduced system locking and blocking and made it possible to keep all users in the system throughout the week nightly settlements for gas invoicing also ran much faster many thanks to the dbas jim ogg and kishroe bharathi for many late nights and weekends many thanks also to the application team and the users for lots of testing before the production rolloutconducting a preplanning session that identified new end of month techniques to improve efficiency the users generated several new ideas including the idea to preprocess pmas the night before running the current mass draft this meeting provided several new approaches a clear plan and cohesive communication throughout the end of month process many thanks to the all the users as well as bob superty bryce baxter melissa ratnala dave nommensen and chris schomer for making this happen many of these ideas will now be part of a standard process the performance monitoring and tuning team reacted quickly to address changes in system performance many thanks to matt pena and the rest of this team for keeping the system up and running as fast as possible during the day release of a new tuned version of the accurals process that runs much faster issues challenges action itemswhile we made progress this month there are still several significant issues and opportunities for improvement the following is a list of the things that went bump in the night and the action items weve identified we experienced several sybase errors early in the week that impacted gas business all of these problems are now fixed this had the following business impacts the bridgeback of deals to sitara was delayed these deals were bridged manually before the end of month valuation we also fixed the code problem that generated th original problemglobal systems replication to unify was down on monday this problem was fixed with a software patch from sybase monday evening all affected deals were then uploaded nominations were completed for these deals on monday through manual estimation by the schedulers communication between the dba group and the application group was delayed on the global systems replication problem this delayed our ability to notify users of the problem communication on problems will be be improved in the future the default assumption will be to notify key application and infrastructure personnel as soon as any serious problem is identified we experienced a hardware issue with a bad server cpu at am on thursday as a result database backups ran into the morning when the server came back up this created slow system response and delayed logins for users until am this problem is now fixed action item kishore will coordinate with randy matson from the infrastructure group to coordinate a stress test of all production server components this will allow us to see if we can find any other marginal components this will be completed by september all service pmas for ena and hplc were not picked up by the settlements process hplc pmas were run manually by the users for ena missing pmas were immaterial and the users decided to close with these results we have now found and fixed the error that caused this problem action item chris schomer is having his team investigate this problem to see if this is just a sybase issue or whether this error could have impacted previous months a determination should be available by september enpower deal load did not load deals with referenced prices correctly these deals have now been successfully loaded and are currently completed through the mass draft process for power we have identified and fixed the software error that caused this problem power mass draft is now running very slow as compared to prior months we are currently working to complete the power mass draft process it will be completed by the user deadline for close of business wednesday sept action item chris schomers team is investigating why the power mass draft is running so slow at present we do not have a definitive answer we hope to develop a definitive answer and action plan by september our current hypothesis for why we have this problem includes data changes we now have a much higher volume of hourly priced dealspotential database index issues we will rebuild all power database indexes and recompile the stored proceduressybase optimizer flakiness we often see sybase suddenly start to have processing problems for no apparent reason update on future tactical and strategic improvementswe have several pending tactical unify performance improvements that are in process these include isolating unify gas on a server of its own delivery of a middle tier mass draft process to reduce locking and blocking upgrade of the middle tier mass draft process to allow for drafting at a deal level rather than just a counterparty level delivery of the nominations and balancing process on a middle tier architectureramesh rao and his team have the strategic projects progressing on schedule we are seeing significant performance gains in our testing of sql server over sybase we also have identified a couple of hardware vendors that could provide very large scaleable computing environments for this type of unify architecture we plan to have all critical evaluation testing completed by the end of september as planned we will present our recommendations along with a highlevel strategic delivery plan by early october let me know if you have any questions or concerns x or thanks

duke ::::::>>>>>> arbitrators in duke here is some feedback i got from within susman godfrey morris several people have been before him as a judge or arbitratorand they all think he is fine recall he also is the one who is a goodfriend of mike beatty paul extremely negative feedback roberts even worse feedback than paul sg took a very contentiousdeposition of him in the exxon valdez coverage case webster fine but probably unacceptable to duke once they know enronsand my relationship with him phillips mixed steve susman likes him and thinks he would be fineothers note that he apparently is extremely close to renfrew havingstrongly urged renfrew as the neutral arbitrator in a matter in whichphillips was the unsuccessful mediatorothers note generally the obvious concern that renfrew may have some specialsway with any former federal judge a rather small and elite clubothers noted that we should beware oklahoma based arbitrators in particularmorris paul and phillips all are from okla where duke is a big playerwith respect to potential counterproposals beatty is considering somenames in addition two people suggested within sg are former state judgeharlan martin who runs jams dallas office and former rd circuit judgearlin adams who ruled in sgs favor as sole arbitrator in our dispute withjack grynbergneal s manne nmannesusmangodfreycom 
duke ::::::>>>>>> duke steve smith called this afternoon he was anxious to know where we stood onthe issue of the third arbitratorhe advised me that they have withdrawn bill paul as a proposed arbitratori disclosed judge websters relationship with me and my wife and his firmsrelationship with enron whereupon smith advised that they would not bewilling to have him as the neutralhe asked me where we stood re morris roberts and sessions sessionssaid i apparently they considered putting former judge bill sessions ontheir list but must have decided not to do so the third proposal waslayne phillipsi told him that we were considering them that beatty was going to callrenfrew to get more info about his relationships with them and that weprobably were going to propose some names of our own next weeksmith advised me that the deadline for selecting the neutral was january monday and that they did not intend to let the schedule slip i told himthat we were aware of the deadline but as a practical matter did not seewhat significance it really had since going to aaa the remedy in the letteragreement would only slow the process down not speed it up it reiteratedabout five times that they expected us to stick to the deadline and did notwant the schedule for the arbitration to slip has this man been speaking tobrian redmond secretlyi told smith five times that we were not going to send them names this weekand were unlikely to agree to one of theirs this week i told him that ifhe insisted on an answer re his remaining three prior to monday that wouldbe easy the answer would be no i told him i preferred to take the timeto actually consider whether one of them was acceptable and assumed thatswhat he would want once he thought about itwe should try to get back to him sometime next week with a response re hisremaining three and unless we are agreeing to one of those some proposalsof our ownrichard have you gotten any feedback from jvdneal s manne nmannesusmangodfreycom 
duke ::::::>>>>>> forward message from kenneth roberts regarding being neutral arb itrator original message from beatty michael l sent friday january am to tyndall barbara subject fw kindly advise regarding participation as a neutral arbitrator mr beatty i could be interested in being a neutral in your case i would need to know more about the case for example i would want to know the nature of the dispute how long the hearing will likely last where the hearing will be held whether the other arbitrators are neutrals and other similar information however for reasons described below i do not think i am a very good candidate as to availability i am tied up all of this month and i will be out of the country all of february and part of march i will be free much of may and june and i may also have most of april open but i cannot be sure of april at this time as for conflicts i do not believe i have any but i have disclosures to make i have known charles renfrew for a long time i was vicepresident and general counsel of exxon and mr renfrew had a similar position with chevron i worked with him on a variety of projects for the american petroleum institute and we have been members of the association of general counsel and other organizations i have seen him at social affairs periodically i believe the last occasion was about months ago when we had dinner together i have also known the general counsel of enron for some years we have been members of various general counsel groups including the association of general counsel we are currently members of the board of the university of texas law school foundation i usually see him several times each year i am currently acting as an independent legal advisor in a matter involving chevron and a department of the united states government this involves a project of the parties to unwind a joint operation it is a project that has lasted several years and is not yet complete as the independent legal advisor i am called in when a legal issue arisesusually over a contract interpretation at that time i act first as a mediator and if there is no settlement i become an arbitrator i mention this situation because of mr renfrews association with chevron i do not know if he has any current involvement with chevron but in any event i do not believe there is any conflict however i would not become a coarbitrator with mr renfrew without discussing this with representatives of chevron and the us department i doubt that either party would object but whether mr renfrew is a neutral might be of interest to them right now i am in the process of reading briefs and drafting an award in the most recent arbitration involving those parties i would not even want to contact them until that work is finished and the award issued for all of the reasons stated above i request that you take my name from your list of potential arbitrators if you should in due course have trouble agreeing on a third arbitrator which is highly unlikely since many very goods ones will be available and wish to have further dialogue with me we can revisit the matter thank you for considering me regards kenneth roberts 
duke ::::::>>>>>> duke per beatty morris is available immediately phillips is unavailable until march at the earliest ken roberts has said to withdraw his name from the list which saves usthe trouble of striking him as previously noted webster has been withdrawn by duke and paul hasbeen withdrawn too beatty says it is because he has been picked by duke astheir party arbitrator in another matter which shows how renfrew wastrying to screw usbeatty suggests jim coleman of carrington coleman as a possibility i donot know himhe also suggests l k smith of oklahoma as a possibility i dont know himeitherrenfrew pressed beatty to agree to someone by this monday same speech smithhad given me beatty demurred renfrew is still out of the country andwill be until the nd of januaryfor scheduling purposes be advised i have just been reset for trial inanother case on february so we need to avoid that week for the hearingwe still need to press forward on the witness interviews and witnesspreparations where do we stand on getting access to some or all of themlets have a conference call when convenient for you richard thanksneal s manne nmannesusmangodfreycom

duke ::::::>>>>>> duke steve smith and i spoke today he stressed repeatedly that the agreement re a schedule is an amendmentto the contract therefore is contractual and binding on the parties andthat we must have a schedule that will allow the arbs to make their award byapril i told him we had no opposition to moving quickly especially ifthe arbs agreed with us as to their extremely limited authority andjurisdiction which was even more contractual that said said i the arbswill set the schedule not us how does smith propose to enforce dukesright to an award by april no response other than to repeat himself he said he thought this was largely a case to be decided by experttestimony i said it seemed just the opposite do they have a the cap isnot a cap expert and a making a profit can still be an economic hardshipexpert no answer he wanted to agree on a date for swapping witness statements expertreports etc he said he wanted to be able to give the arbs an agreedschedule by the time we have our first call i told him there was no way wecould do that because until the arbs resolved the dispute over the scope ofthe proceeding i had no way of knowing what kind of discovery i would needhe said he saw my point he plainly hopes to present evidence by witness statement rather thanjust depos or live testimony i told him we would want to depose mostwitnesses from whom he planned to offer a statement that said i said isaw no problem with witness statements thinking that this may be theeasiest way to get testimony from rebecca mcdonald among others he asked me if we would agree to have the hearing in san francisco itold him i thought the contract specified houston he said that itspecified houston for the arbitration but that it didnt say thehearing had to be here i told him that sounded like an argument by acompany that says a cap is not a cap he did not laugh i then tried adifferent approach i told him it sounded like the agreement to arbitratein houston was contractual he told me he envisioned the hearing lasting or days i told himthat i thought that was right if the issues were a is the cap a cap andb is the cap an economic hardship he returned to topic and implored me to move things ahead quickly itold him that to my knowledge we had not been asked by morris for aninitial conference but that we were ready willing and able to have onewhenever asked i did not ask him whether duke had let all of the california utilitiesit has been fleecing get out of their contracts with duke because they posedsome sort of economic hardship i did learn some interesting trivia about him he has triplet yearold sons maybe thats why he always sounds so worn outneal s manne nmannesusmangodfreycom cdtf

ecogas ::::::>>>>>> memo to file wisvest discussions and ecogas sa on friday august jb and i had a discussion re engaging wisvest in a dialogue to resolve some of the major issues around the san antonio project in that discussion i reiterated what was discussed at the board meeting which was a we needed to finalize the numbers re the wmi royalty renegotiation b verify the expected epc costs to complete the project c revise the project proforma to reflect the revisions in a and b and d run sensitivity analyses on the level of subordination wisvest would have to accept in order to make the project economics viable in our phone conversation on we again agreed this was the right course of action to take subsequent to that call jb had conversations w derek price at wisvest re prospective meeting dates and exchanging various info re the project in another phone conversation on monday august i specifically asked jb whether he had sent the project proformas andor other proprietary info to derek price to which jb responded no he said he sent him summary info but did not send him the proforma i then asked him to forward to me copies of everything he had sent to derek what he sent to me was some very basic emails and financial summary info i also asked derek to forward to me everything jb had sent to him and i got a whole lot more including the fullblown project modelproforma this has seriously diminished all of our negotiating leverageon i became aware of some efforts that appear to involve jb in setting up a south american version of ecogas ecogas sa and called him to inquire as to what was going on in our phone conversation jb explicitly denied any involvement including any ownership in such an enterprise i also asked jb to forward to me by friday copies of any and all documents agreements etc relating to ecogas sa to date he has sent me nothing but an undated draft mou as well as some misc and meaningless correspondence undated andor old emails etc none of the info sent is what i asked for on august complete execution copies of the mou regarding ecogas sa including ownership interests etc as well as copies of articles of incorporation for ecogas sa etcwho is ecogas sa where is it currently incorporated who are the beneficial owners under what authority are you transacting business what is your title etc jb continues to reference nothing has been signed incorporated etc then why is jbs signature evidenced on an amendment to the memorandum of understanding ecogas sa tortolajcs jb referenced the need to directing our efforts to resolution of the crisis rather than continuing personal distractions and devisiveness for the past couple of months he has been asked to generate cash by selling assets greenhouse gas emission credits etc to the best of my knowledge ecogas has yet to see one pennyas always there seems to be a direct contradiction between the stories and the facts

ecogas ::::::>>>>>> barbara bransondan williams inquiry re ecogas payments richard in response to your memo dated first of all im confused by her attorneys letter dated regarding the reference of a per share prices of andor i dont have a clue where this number came from nowhere in the securities purchase agreement spa is there any reference to a per share price under sec all prices referenced are in millions of dollars aggregate formatpursuant to sec of the securities purchase agreement spa dated ectmi purchased from the selling shareholders of the stock of ecogas for an initial payment of million of this amount million was withheld pursuant to sec g pending ecogas successful termination of montauks right of first offer on or before this milestone was not achieved until march when a restructuring of various ecogasmontaukgsf the former jv partnership between ecogas and montauk issues was completed therefore of the million initial payment million was forfeited for ecogas inability to meet its obligations pursuant to the spain summary article ii secs b and c of the spa includes provisions for an intermediate payment and final payment respectively subject to certain milestones being met these milestones can be described basically as a twopart test the first criteria requires ecogas to be producing and selling in excess of mmbtud of natural gas methane and the second criteria being a requirement for ecogas to be doing son in a profitable manner ie an ebitda test both test criteria are applicable to both the intermediate and final payments which means the criteria would have to be satisfied on and in theory both payments and the criteria requirements are part of very complex calculations involving the translation of a number of defined terms within the spa practically speaking they can be summarized as a gas production and sales in excess of mmbtud and b enough positiveexcess cash flow above and beyond operating expenses ga and capex to provide a minimum rate of return for the record on ecogas production and sales rate was approximately mmbtud significantly below the mmbtud requirement and their cash flow was actually negative theoretically the criteria could still be met insofar as the final payment is concerned since the deadline is not until the obvious issue here is their false misconception that they are due installment payments both the intermediate and final payments referenced above are predicated upon ecogas achieving two very specific performancebased milestones neither of which of close to being satisfied as of the intermediate payment date as i said above the final payment is still outstanding but is likewise subject to ecogas successfully achieving the same perfomancebased criteriaif they persist and want to have the actual data i would suggest you have them contact jerrel branson barbaras former husband and have him explain the details andor supply the information his number in jackson hole wy is randy

ees_neg_ctc ::::::>>>>>> fw direct access legislation and the impact on settlement discus sions with uccsu resending message original message from mday sent friday may pm to kristen bird awuquinnemanuelcom richardsanders enron robertcwilliamsenroncom cc jbennett subject direct access legislation and the impact on settlement discussions with uccsu richard sanders and bob williams asked that i provide the following brief memo in order to summarize wherer the legislative efforts are at this time and how they might impact settlement discussions with the close of the first extraordinary session today a second extraordinary session will open on monday and all the existing but unpassed bills will be reintroducedso we are told that means there will continue to be at least bills which would substantially protect the rights of customers to choose direct access although both contemplate that under varying circumstances the customer could be required to pay an exit fee what is relatively likely is this a direct access bill will pass this session it will likely create the following situation any customer who has not been on direct access continuously since before january will have used some power purchased by dwr while being charged bundled utility rates far lower than the actual cost if these customers like uc eventually elect to return to direct access they will be required to pay the shortfall that has accrued while they were on bundled service other stranded costs which may be incurred by dwr after the customer leaves bundled service for direct access may also be passed on in an exit fee this would include stranded contract costs if dwr has contracted for more long term power than it has customers as well as any costs related to the bond financing intended to pay for the long term power contracts we hope that the legislation will have a provision excusing the customers from such an exit fee if dwr has not purchased all the net short power by long term contracts and dwr can match its supply to the new lower demand simply by reducing daily spot purchases uc would potentially face the first type of exit fee in any event it may face the second although there is a possibility of a short open enrollement period following passage of the bill which would allow customers to switch to da immediately without paying the second type of exit fee there may be other exceptions to the exit fees for customers who install self generation or distributed generation this might affect a few uc campuses but not all at least one of the bills might give the cpuc enough discretion to permit it to impose onerous conditions on direct access and thereby prohibit it however this provision is strongly opposed by many customer groups and we believe it can be defeated we do not know when the direct access legislation will be adopted we hope within the next month we will keep you advised and please feel free to call for an update at any time mike day

of staff regarding direct access in the legislation working its way through the assembly he relayed the information during an informational hearing that an assembly committee had on the bill yesterday in sacramento see previous note attached below for more a detailed description of da provisions in the billa new print of the bill is likely to be issued todaywith respect to da the governor is apparently responsible for the temporary suspension of da in the billassembly ds and other market participants lobbied him hard explaining that since the bill covers all costs of bonds and dwr contracts through exit fees there is no reason to suspend da the governor is resisting hard stating that he wants time for the market to stabilizeso it looks like the governors plan is to have a bill that provides for direct access as of and have the puc temporarily suspend da from september to were continuing to work with with business customers to eliminate or significantly shorten the suspensionthe bill apparently will also have amendments stating that any customer who has switched by august yesterday will not be responsible for any dwr going forward contracts the customer will have to pay for any power consumed that dwr purchased on the ious behalf between jan and the date of the switchthe bill apparently will require that any customer switching between yesterday and sept be responsible for dwr going forward contracts though details of how that would work were not clearthe stated reason for wanting to insert an amendment on the august rd date is to prevent a rush to direct access between now and sept there are currently no efforts to break or othewise dissallow any contracts signed prior to sept finally the bill apparently will also give selfgeneration priority over direct access in each open season the bill would set aside mw of the short position each year for customers to do self gen if the self gen is not subscribed the mws would go to dathe bill including these amendments and other amendments related to other issues is supposed to be released todaythe bill will be heard in the assembly committee on monday afternoonwe continue to work with the business customers to improve the da and self gen provisionsit remains unclear whether there is sufficient support for the bill to pass the assembly the politicians are very reluctant to pass any edison bail out bill and the political pressure not to vote on any bailout is significant and growing but the governor is working the bill very hardmirant is actively working against the bill mirant is passing around a poll allegedly showing that any member that votes for a bailout could lose reelection mirant is also distributing a letter implicitly threatening to take edison into involuntary bankruptcy if the bill passesthe bill also has to make it through the senate our lobbyist had a conversation yesterday with the senate president john burton who said flatly that hes not doing anything but there is much to trade in the final weeks of the session and the possibility of burton doing a deal is with respect to the bills provisions preventing edison from paying wholesale providers with the dedicated rate component included edison representatives at the hearing yesterday announced that edison intends to issue first mortgage bonds to pay the suppliers edison also said that under the assembly version of the bill edison believes that it would have the borrowing capacity to issue the first mortgage bondsmore info to follow as it becomes available if anyone has any questions dont hesitate to contact mebestjeff original messagefrom dasovich jeff sent wednesday august pmto dasovich jeff subject latest legislative version of direct access the following is a summary of the direct access provisions in the bill language released this afternoon reflecting the deal that davis cut with assembly things are very fluid and these provisions could change significantly i was just informed by the large business customers that they just met with the davis and hertzbergs staff and the staff have agreed to amend the da provisions to make them considerably more favorable for customers and suppliers they also said that favorable provisions with respect to selfgen would also be added to the bill they said that these new amendments could come out as early as tonite or tomorrow morning and that the bill may be heard tomorrownote in addition to the da provisions the bill also includes provisions that explicitly recognize the px credit as part of edisons undercollection and permit edison to pay debts associated with the negative px credit the bill does not authorize edison to pay power suppliers however and leaves that portion of edisons debt for edisons management and shareholders to addresssummary of direct access provisionsthe program would begin january its unclear what would happen to da between now and january presumably the decision to suspend or not between now and then would stay with the california puc days after the effective date of the bill and every months thereafter dwr would provide information to the puc showing the net short positionevery months the puc would hold an open season permitting customers to switch to da kwandabove customers would have days to decide to switch once the puc has announced the open season under kw customers would have dayscustomers who switch to da would be responsible for paying the customers proportionate share of the utilitys undercollection and the customers proportionate share of dwrs receivables if any for power previously delivered by dwr but not yet fully paid for by customersin addition if the number of customers who elect to choose to go da in the open season exceeds the

international ::::::>>>>>> insurance claim under cardsu policy bruce just fyi i am already on top of this ken blades and i had a conversation with justin williams yesterday about this ongoing saga which has been ongoing a long time essentially heres where we are and why it is a good thing that united india has sued us in the london court in the early part of the dispute we gave consideration to litigation vs arbitration but we could only sue ui in india which was a bad optionseveral months ago after lengthy settlement discussions with united india ui and reinsurers about dpcs dsu claim resulting from the first rotor problems ui served dpc with a notice of arbitration under the policy the notice was curious because ui clearly disputed both liability and quantum however the policys arbitration clause states that arbitration can only include issues of quantumthrough a series of correspondence we believe ui has agreed to arbitrate liability quantum in the same proceeding and to include reinsurers in the arbitration the cut through clause in the policy enables dpc to recover directly from the reinsurers it appears however at least we speculate that ui has suddenly become uncomfortable with the anomaly that while they have served dpc a notice of arbitration the clause limits arbitration to quantum not liability hence uis declaratory judgment action in the london commercial court to determine liability now this gives us an option we didnt have earlier litigation in the london court since they have submitted to jurisdiction or arbitration there are pros cons to both which we are discussing with justin and peteran interesting piece of the puzzle is that ui is now trying to realign the parties since dpc is the insured seeking recovery the reason ui wants to do this is because i it would put the burden of proof on dpc as claimant ii ui as claimant will have a very difficult time meeting its burden of proof on a dec action because they do not have all the technical information dpc has pros of litigation the london court is less likely to permit this realignment than arbitrators who are typically more lenient in procedural matters of this type we also believe the london court will be cheaper no cost of arbitrators and quicker since there are statutory time lines ui has no incentive to resolve this expeditiously and has at every opportunity slowed the arbitration process by rejecting everything dpc proposes from the number of arbitrators to the names submitted etc also in the london court there is a strong possibility dpc can get an advance security for attorneys fees as the defendant which is not possible in arbitrationdownside of litigation it is less likely that dpc can litigate directly against the reinsurers for procedural reasons furthermore dpc could potentially end up in two proceedings litigation to determine liability arbitration to determine quantum which could take longer and be expensive ken blades believes the loss adjuster stipulated to quantum in a prior meeting which would enable us to avoid that scenario until we see the document however we cannot determine whether the stipulation is enforceable because of issues of authority etcthe bottom line is now that ui has sued us in london court we have a choice we didnt have before we plan to obtain kens document re the stipulation send a letter to ui and then see their reaction before we decide now that weve been served it just shortens our time limit to do this im inclined to go the litigation route but i want to see that stipulation document first and discuss with linklaters its value either as an enforceable agreement or its strength as evidence of quantum call me if you have questions in the meantime ill keep you informedmichelle forwarded by

pichardoenrondevelopmentenrondevelopment subject re smith enron cogeneration plant shareholder complaint katrin this is indeed a sensitive matter and must be treated accordingly i do strongly suggest that before anything you talk to michelle blaine of our litigation team who is very up to date on the class action cases the costamabar comunity has against seclp there are many half truths and many lies involved the plant team has for long been aware of the responsability and are very diligent and careful to comply with the environmental standard s applicable one problem here is that across the bay from where we are there are two other power plants one of them which i managed and also produce noise a nd air emissions one within applicable world bank standards but no the other which belongs to a third group the prevailing winds bring the emissions fr om those plants directly to our plant and the costambar community our air emissions within wb standards monitored during the year mostly go down wind southeast away from costambar so there are many variables involved we must be careful with the shareholder letter since it is very likely the person may be part of the class action and is fishing for something but michelle can advice you appropriately if you need any further data from th e plant after talking to michelle please let me know many thanks otto from katrin haux pm to otto

otto the following shareholder complaint about smith enrons plant in puerto pla ta was sent to investor relations and today forwarded to our attention requesting assistance with this matter the gentlemen sending the complain t owns a home in costambar a residential community which according to his email has been negatively affected by our plant he mentions a disturbi ng noise level decreased air quality dwindling property value and power outages worse than prior to the plant going online the fact that we take any shareholder complaint very serious i am preparing a response to this letter and i am asking for your help could you provide me with any background information on the alleged complaints and confirm or deny the issues at matter are there any plans on the way to address any possible issues it had been my impression that the smith enron plant not only had no negative effects on the environment but that great efforts were made to improve the local community through community relations programs like the public park adoption supply of school materials shipment of medical supplies and the municipal nursery support can you expand on this i realize that this matter has to be managed with extreme caution i clear ly will coordinate my reply with you and seek additional approval from legal prior to responding to the gentlemen thank you in advance for your support and cooperation best regards katrin original message from gordon badger mailtobadgerestationcom sent friday december am to investorrelationsenroncom cc publicrelationsenroncom subject smith enron cogeneration plant puerto plata dominican republic iam an enron shareholder through my holding company first foundation financial services inc five or six years ago smith enron floated in and installed a power generati on plant at puerto plata in the dominican republic generating power to sell to the dominican power agency presentations were made at the time to the loca l mostly american and canadian residents in the community of costambar whe re the plant was to be and was built that the noise would not exceed the sound of the ocean that there would be no air quality damage and that the power outs in costambar would cease i have a home in costambar about a half mile away and over a large hill fro m the plant the sound is audible in the entire neighborhood when they clear the boilers it is oppressiveear shattering for th e entire community of homes in spite of the retrofit silencers there is often molecular ash falling and on occasion well documented with pictures total black soot coverage down wind for a qua rter mile or more costambar is on the countrys grid and has power outs for an av erage of two or more hours per day worse than before in other words all of the welldocumented and witnessed undertakings have been proven false i was proud of enron at the beginning because there seemed to be a legitima te attempt to do the right thing as time has progressed however it has beco me clear that there is no solution to the continuing problems it is also obvious that the only right thing is to pull up stakes and float the plant to the original alternate location down the coast or to another country the problems are insoluble you simply cant plop a large energy burning facility beside an upscale community without event for a company as knowledgeable as enron should be concerning the effects to nearby residents it borders on inexcusable that the plant would have been built where it is in the first place having attempted any number of solutions and now recognizi ng the absence of solution the continuing inexcusable action is to carry on regardless as ahs been the case for the past two or more years enron has been sued by the adjacent large hotel which although only two or three years old when the plant was built had to shut down because of unending guest complaints and refund demands it now sits as a rotting monument to the problems unfortunately for enron the owners are a promine nt dominican family i am told they already have a large judgement but are going for more if they havent already they surely will and they s urely should what was once an attractive and productive facility is useless and will remain fallow as long as the plant is there soon it will fall totally beyond repair and there will be no alternative but to raze it houses in the immediate area say mile homes have fallen to in value and houses in the community at large have fallen to in value dependent upon their proximity to the plant whereas the hotel value is in the low millions and the ultimate award will likely be commensurate the loss in value to the homes is in the tens of millions beyond these financi al events some of the people in the community are beginning to complain about new respiratory and other pollution related ailments the rough estimate of damages ranges between us million and million without considering the health issues the community has sensible and responsible leadership and has responded in a sensible and responsible way dissatisfied with the failure to solve the problem in any approaching a timely fashion the homeowners have recently retained competent counsel nearly homeowners have joined the class action to recover their lost property value the issue of determining lost value is about to formally begin and the total loss calculated soon there will be no turning back because of the homeowners investment in the act ion if there were an announcement that the plant is to be moved the claim from the community would almost certainly go away with the possible exception of damages for the few homes that have changed hands during the plants li fe here if the plant remains the action will proceed and all things bei ng equitable which they ultimately become in the dominican court system ther e will be large claims awarded i imagine they will massively overshadow the few million dollars to move or dismantle the plant i now take off my homeowners hat and return to my position as sharehold er the following italicized statements form part of the enron mission statement as noted above the company has so far failed to implement these visions as noted environment in everything we do we operate safely and with concern for the environment the way we do a job will affect how our children and our neighbors childre n will live in the future this is a responsibility we take seriously in all the different places around the world where we do business the costambar environment has been seriously effected from a noise and air pollution point of view integrity we work with customers and prospects openly honestly and sincerely when we say we will do something we will do it when we say we cannot or will not do something then we wont do it the community was seriously misled and enron has been unable to develop solutions to restore or correct their documented assertions creativity we think the entrepreneurial approach stimulates creativity it calls for n ew insights new ways of looking at problems and opportunities and a strong sense of urgency the problems have persisted for several years with no recent new initiative s directed at solving them respect we treat others as we would like to be treated ourselves we do not tolerat e abusive or disrespectful treatment ruthlessness callousness and arroganc e dont belong here the golden rule has long since gone wanting in this situation it is simply not responsible for enron to continue with a facility that has and continues to damage a community financially and from a health point of view and it is not financially responsible of enron management to risk the payment of tens of millions in claims arising from damages that can otherwi se be avoided at quantifiable and much lower cost im sure the company has a thick file on this issue already im equa lly sure however that the measure of damages is reaching a new phase and is approaching the point where there will be no will by the litigants to turn back the plant was constructed during the waning days of the environmental ly insensitive beleaguer government the country has undergone substantial changes since then including changes in the rule of law and the judiciary there is now a new liberal government that is likely to be very generous wi th one of its previously model communities if the matter reaches the courts the loss to the shareholders of enron from inactivity of management is like ly to be immense and is avoidable i would appreciate a comment on managements views as quickly as possibl e sincerely d gordon badger badgerestationcom puerto plata tel fax

attorney client communication attorney work product harvey morris esq california public utilities commission public utilities commission san francisco california re i subpoenas served on enron power marketing inc epmi enron energy services operations inc and enron energy services inc collectively referred to as ees enron energy marketing corporation eemc and portland general electric corporation portland generalcollectively sometimes referred to as the enron entities harvey i am writing in response to the various voicemail exchanges and phone calls between michael day on behalf of the enron entities and yourself during the past few weeks here is the current status as we understand it based upon the agreements we reached between october and october date of your confirming email the enron entities have made the following document productions in response to the subpoenas served by california public utilities commission the commission october bate nos enron entities on behalf of all enron entities responsive to request nos october bate nos p on behalf of portland general responsive to request nos and november bate no enron entities diskette with eeseemc retail data responsive to request nos to to and november bate no p diskettes with portland general data which include approximate wholesale transactions responsive to request nos to to and we believe with these productions we have complied with the october th agreement with respect to portland general and eeseemc as you know these productions were all made reserving the enron entities rights to object or challenge the subpoenas and reserving any claims defenses objections jurisdictional or otherwise or other responses we originally had hoped to have all of the transactional data for epmi as defined in our october th email available for production by october th however we were also mindful of your expressed expectation that any data provided be useful and reliable the collection of data you requested in the subpoenas is neither kept electronically in the same location nor organized as you requested it in fact during our review of some of the data we found significant errors that called into question the methodology by which the data was extracted from existing information when it became apparent that we could not accurately estimate how long it would take to get reliable data given the volume of transactions involved we informed you of the problem we now understand that if we cannot give you a firm date when the balance of the transactional data will be available the commission believes it will have no choice but to seek to compel production before the federal regulatory energy commission ferc we understand the pressure that you must be under to get data immediately but we cannot at this time give you another date in the immediate future by which we are certain that we will be able to produce accurate data moreover during the iterim between october th and today a number of significant events have occurred that we believe bear on the subpoenas served on the enron entities first we understand that many other parties who were served with the same subpoenas have not provided the detailed information requested and have objected on a variety of very sound legal grounds second the commission itself has without a hearing on the motion unilaterally revised the proposed protective order that is supposed to govern these productions and summarily denied other changes sought by other parties served third the commission has filed its motion before ferc seeking an order compelling the production of the data from those other parties that have objected and seeking an expedited hearing and production schedule we note that the reasons stated in the motion before ferc as the basis for the production are materially different than the reasons originally stated in the ex parte application to the commissions own administrative law judge who issued the subpoenas finally ferc itself has completed its investigation and has issued a tentative order as of november originally the enron entities had been prepared to accept most favored nation treatment with respect to protective orders and requests by others to limit the scope of the subpoenas and produce information that was available however given both the commissions stated urgent need for an immediate answer that epmi cannot in good faith give despite substantial effort date for production of reliable and accurate transaction data and the uncertainty created by the above described intervening events epmi believes it has no choice but to serve its formal objections and responses to the subpoenas and await the commissions threatened motion to compel before ferc we also understand from our discussions with you that the commission has created various lists or categories for the entities that have been served with subpoenas we understand that there is a list for those entities that have been cooperating a list for those who have been delaying and a list for those who have been objecting and exercising their rights to challenge the subpoenas we understand that the commission intends to punish by whatever means it has available those entities that object and exercise their rights to challenge the subpoenas we deplore these tactics but despite all of the efforts to cooperate described above we understand that epmi may in fact be moved from the cooperating list to the group to be punished for exercising its rights if you have and questions or comments please do not hesitate to

enron energy marketingcorporation eemc and portland general electric corporationportland generalcollectively sometimes referred to as the enronentitiesharvey i am writing in response to the various voicemail exchanges andphone calls between michael day on behalf of the enron entities andyourself during the past few weeks here is the current status as weunderstand it based upon the agreements we reached between october and october date of your confirming email the enronentities have made the following document productions in response to thesubpoenas served by california public utilities commission thecommission october bate nos enron entities on behalfof all enron entities responsive to request nos october bate nos p on behalf of portlandgeneral responsive to request nos and november bate no enron entities diskette witheeseemc retail data responsive to request nos to to and november bate no p diskettes with portlandgeneral data which include approximate wholesale transactionsresponsive to request nos to to and we believe with these productions we have complied with the octoberth agreement with respect to portland general and eeseemc as youknow these productions were all made reserving the enron entities rightsto object or challenge the subpoenas and reserving any claims defensesobjections jurisdictional or otherwise or other responses we originally had hoped to have all of the transactional data forepmi as defined in our october th email available for production byoctober th however we were also mindful of your expressedexpectation that any data provided be useful and reliable the collectionof datayou requested in the subpoenas is neither kept electronically in the samelocation nor organized as you requested it in fact during our review ofsome of the data we found significant errors that called into questionthe methodology by which the data was extracted from existing informationwhen it became apparent that we could not accurately estimate how long itwould take to get reliable data given the volume of transactionsinvolved we informed you of the problem we now understand that if wecannot giveyou a firm date when the balance of the transactional data will beavailable the commission believes it will have no choice but to seek tocompel production before the federal regulatory energy commissionferc we understand the pressure that you must be under to get dataimmediately but we cannot at this time give you another date in theimmediate future by which we are certain that we will be able to produceaccurate data moreover during the interim between october th and today a numberof significant events have occurred that we believe bear on the subpoenasserved on the enron entities first we understand that many otherparties who were served with the same subpoenas have not provided thedetailed information requested and have objected on a variety of verysound legal grounds second the commission itself has without a hearingon the motion unilaterally revised the proposed protective order that issupposed to govern these productions and summarily denied other changessought by other parties served third the commission has filed itsmotion before ferc seeking an order compelling the production of the datafrom those other parties that have objected and seeking an expeditedhearing and production schedule we note that the reasons stated in themotion before ferc as the basis for the production are materially differentthan the reasons originally stated in the ex parte application to thecommissions own administrative law judge who issued the subpoenas ferchas also issued its tentative order as of november covering some ofthe same topics as the commissions subpoena request finally ferc hasrequested information in specific areas from a number of entitiesincluding enron enron is simultaneously working on preparing responses tofercs requests originally the enron entities had been prepared to accept mostfavored nation treatment with respect to protective orders and requestsby others to limit the scope of the subpoenas and produce informationthat was available however given both the commissions stated urgent needfor an immediate answer that epmi cannot in good faith give despitesubstantial effort date for production of reliable and accuratetransaction data and the uncertainty created by the above describedintervening events epmi believes it has no choice but to serve itsformal objections and responses to the subpoenas and await the commissionsthreatened motion to compel before ferc we also understand from our discussions with you that the commissionhas created various lists or categories for the entities that have beenserved with subpoenas we understand that there is a list for thoseentities that have been cooperating a list for those who have beendelaying and a list for those who have been objecting and exercisingtheir rights to challenge the subpoenas we understand that the commissionintends to punish by whatever means it has available those entitiesthat object and exercise their rights to challenge the subpoenas wedeplorethese tactics but despite all of the efforts to cooperate describedabove we understand that epmi may in fact be moved from the cooperatinglist to the group to be punished for exercising its rights if you have and questions or comments please do

market for wholesale electricity during thespring and summer of a group of electricity generators and tradersincluding defendants exercising market power unlawfully manipulated thecalifornia wholesale electricity market resulting in grossly inflatedwholesale electricity prices throughout the state and much of the westernunited states defendants accomplished this result by inter aliaimproperly using confidential real time generator capacity use andmaintenance data and transmission system flow data to game the wholesaleelectricity market by withholding electrical generating capacity from thecalifornia power exchanges forward markets by improperly parking powerwith affiliates in other states which was later resold in california atinflated rates by scheduling previously unplanned plant outages to coincidewith other plants planned maintenance shutdowns and by schedulingtransmission flows to cause or exacerbate congestion the improper use of confidential real time data was in violation ofthe california tariff by which defendants are authorized to sell wholesaleelectricity within california by engaging in said unfair business practices defendants havedirectly and severely damaged purchasers of electricity supplied through thecalifornia power exchange as noted in the august san diego uniontribune the utility bills of all electric ratepayers in san diego areexorbitant rates that were cents per kilowatt hour have risen to cents per kilowatt hour in just three months nothing short ofconfiscatory rates in its november order the federal energy regulatorycommission ferc expressly found that electricity prices in californiahave been maintained at unjust and unreasonable levels during the relevantperiod though it determined that it did not have the authority to mandaterefunds or other retroactive relief with respect thereto in its november response to the november st ferc order the california publicutilities commission cpuc concluded that due to market manipulation bywholesale energy producers and traders customers of electricity suppliedthrough the california power exchange had been overcharged more than billion dollars during the summer of in its november nd response tothe november st ferc order even the california independent system operatorcaiso which manages californias transmission system infrastructure knownas the power grid found that

anticipateany difficulty with the management of this action v common allegations of facta the california wholesale electricity markets in california deregulated its electricity industry and requiredthe states privately owned utility companies to divest themselves of theirgenerating plants the purpose of deregulation was to introduce competitioninto the electricity markets with the intention of reducing rates forelectrical power in fact however certain participants in this recentlyderegulated industry have in violation of their operating tariff takenadvantage of structural flaws in the system and improperly obtainedconfidential competitor information to artificially inflate prices forelectricity yielding themselves billions of dollars in windfall profits atthe expense of california consumers as part of the deregulation several new entities were created tofacilitate the workings of this new market californias investor ownedutilities pacific gas electric pge southern california edison sceand san diego gas electric sdge theutilities now purchaseelectricity for their customers from independent generators and tradersincluding defendants through a market known as the california powerexchange px the px maintains a market for the purchase and sale ofwholesale electricity through a variety of forward contracts and real timemarkets under the california deregulatory scheme the utilities wereuntil just recently required to purchase power through the px andprohibited from independently contracting for power outside this market the deregulated market also led to the creation of the californiaindependent system operator caiso the caiso is an independentnonprofit corporation though its managing board includes representativesfrom among the generators and traders that was created to manage the flowof electricity and ensure reliability along the long distance highvoltagepower lines that make up the bulk of californias transmission systemapproximately of californias electricity is distributed through thecaiso managed power grid the caiso monitors electrical loads iedemand on an ongoing basis and ensures that there is an adequate supply ofpower to meet that demand the caiso accomplishes this by maintaining a real time imbalancemarket the real time market when the caiso receives bids fromsuppliers that are insufficient to meet the demand for power it must acceptany bid which then sets the marketclearing price for that hour under thesingle price auction system used by the caiso all sellers of electricity inthe real time market automatically receive the market clearing price whichis the second highest price paid in the market even if they were willingto sell and had in fact bid to sell electricity at lower prices thismechanism allows sophisticated market participants such as defendants togame the market by withholding bids in an effort to maximize the clearingprice the real time market was not designed to handle large transactionsbut merely to provide a mechanism to correct short term imbalances in supplyand demand defendants nonetheless pushed a substantial portion of thedaily wholesale electricity sales into this market by under bidding capacityto the forward market leaving wholesale customers no alternative place toobtain the power to satisfy their retail customers demand the caiso also manages the replacement reserve market which is usedto balance supply and demand of electricity sellers in the replacementreserve market receive a fixed premium for having available capacity ifcalled upon by the iso to deliver energy sellers in the replacement reservemarket also receive the real time market price thus if generators knowthat capacity is short they have an incentive to withhold supplies from thespot markets and push as much as possible into the replacement reservemarket access to real time generating information facilitates suchgaming of the markets by demonstrating in real time available competingsupply in times of high demand the caiso has the authority to purchaseenergy from outofstate sources as to which there is no operative pricecap the caiso was forced to do so during the summer of californiagenerators and marketers can export electricity to surrounding markets inorder to create artificial shortages and drive up prices in the californiamarkets they can then resell that electricity to the caiso at inflated anduncapped prices as the px compliance committee noted in its november report the px compliance report during periods of high outofmarket purchases when prices are above therealtime energy price cap instate generators have an incentive to exportenergy out of california surrounding control areas can effectively parkthat energy for resale to the caiso outofmarket calls and return it to thestateid at p notably the summer of witnessed an approximately increasein exports from the california energy market despite the very high pricesand short supplies that existed in the state market power is defined by the caiso as the ability tosignificantly influence market prices and cause them to vary fromcompetitive levels for a material period of time generators and suppliersincluding defendants can exercise market power by physically oreconomically withholding electricity from the market moving electricity outof the california markets and by pricing and bidding their resources inways that impede the efficiency of the market notably the california energy market consists of a relatively smallnumber of firms some of which control a substantial fraction of the totalgenerating capacity the small number of suppliers facilitates the exerciseof market power during periods of high demand even when there is not atrue scarcity of available generating capacity in addition the relativelyinelastic demand for energy further facilitates the exercise of such marketpowerb defendants improper acts prior to may the caiso began supplying the western systemscoordinating council wscc an organization consisting of electricindustry participants including defendants with real time industry data asto electricity generating levels known as metering data and transmissionsystem flow data known as scheduling data pertaining to individual marketparticipants through the wscc internet web site wholesale electricitymarket participants

transmission and generation capacity such asloop flow facility outages level of hydropower output or seasonal limitson energy imports from outofstate or actions or behaviors that mayotherwise render the system and the iso markets vulnerable to pricemanipulation to the detriment of their efficiency market participants used their trade organization the wscc toshare access to and use real time information notwithstanding the fact thatits publication and use violated the isos operating procedures as setforth in tariffs and protocols that were filed with and approved by fercand by adoption made part of the contracts by which defendants wereauthorized to sell electricity to the px those tariffs and protocolsrequired that such data be kept confidential to prevent gaming the marketand not be used by market participants to engage in anticompetitivebehavior it has been reported in the dow jones work com newswire on october thatelectricity generators may have used realtime plant activity reports fromthe states grid operator to their advantage in californias wholesaleelectricity market according to an official with the western systemscoordinating council at issue is realtime information the california independent systemoperator provided the western systems coordinating council a governmentalsic organization that monitors electricity reliability in the westernus about power plant activity in the statethe realtime information allows market participants to access datavia an internet site that shows how much capacity a plant with more than megawatts has online at any given moment the information was intended to be used to monitor electric reliability onthe grid last month however the isos attorneys alerted the wscc that the data isbeing used against them and to game the market according to bill commishdirector of dispatch with the wscc commish said generators could use the information to withhold supply anddrive up power prices or to identify transmission congestion in a particularregion and use that to gouge customershowever the iso which controls about of the states power grid andrealtime market may have violated a ferc rule because it is required tokeep such information confidential for days an iso attorney told thewsccbeginning monday the iso will no longer provide such information to thewscc or other market participants starting on or about may defendants used such real timedata to exercise market power by among other things reducing their outputstrategically underbidding supply to the forward markets and exportingelectricity from the state in order to drive up the real time market priceand other market prices as a direct result of their improper access to anduse of this information the price of wholesale electricity spiked sharplyupwards on may and has remained at artificially inflated pricesever since ferc cpuc and caiso dept of market analysis have all nowconcluded that market participants should be excluded from the caiso board as noted in the north county times on october a case study of san diego countys two big power plants has concluded thatthey held back from full production of electricity in june even as pricesskyrocketed and californias power manager was scrambling for supplies toprevent blackoutsto the studys author the low production in san diego county is clearevidence that the companies that generate and trade electricity in ca werecreating an artificial shortage to drive up prices mcculloughs hourbyhour analysis of power output for june found that theencina plant in carlsbad generated percent of the megawatt hours that itcould have during periods when prices were higher than the plants cost ofproduction the south bay power plant in chula vista generated percentof what would be expected under traditional economic theoryeconomists estimate it costs per megawatt hour to generateelectricity at the plants the wholesale price in june averaged permegawatt houra separate analysis conducted by the north county times revealed mysteriouscutbacks in carlsbad during a heady market of skyhigh prices investigators and market analysts have documented extensive evidence thatelectricity traders have waited until prices rose on californias marketthis summer before they would commit their power plants to productionwe did see evidence of withholding in the bidding according to jimdetmers the isos operations chief in addition defendants used such real time information about theircompetitors to improperly withhold electrical supplies from the forwardmarkets operated by the px in order to take advantage of the isos need tobalance supply and demand in the spot market and thereby benefit from thesingle price auction system by obtaining the highest price paid at any givenperiod in addition certain defendants sold or parked electricity withaffiliates in other states in order to artificially drive up prices in thecalifornia markets they then sold that electricity back into thecalifornia markets at the artificially inflated prices they had createdthese tactics forced buyers in the california wholesale electricity marketto purchase more than of their electricity needs in the inflated spotmarket rather than the less than that should be sold in that market thespot market was solely intended to satisfy last minute fluctuations in thedemand for energyc results of defendants activities from late may through the present defendants activities haveraised wholesale electricity prices to record levels well above the ratesthat would prevail in a competitive marketplace and disproportionate to thecosts of generating that electricity those prices have resulted in anapproximate tripling of electricity rates in areas served by sdge whereretail rates have been deregulated and represent in large part a passthrough of sdges costs for such power which it purchases from thedefendant generators and traders through the california power exchange as the market surveillance committee msc of the caiso concludedin its september report the msc report during the months of mayand june revenues from the sale of iso loads in the california energymarket were and respectively above the revenues that would havebeen generated under competitive pricing conditions msc report at p the msc report unambiguously concluded that market participants exercised asignificant amount of market power in the california energy marketsbeginning as early as october and increasing dramatically during theclass period id at pp the average market clearing price in californias wholesale marketsduring august of was mwh under moderate load conditionscompared with mwh a year earlier while load demand conditions incalifornia during august were slightly higher than in august theywere similar to those during august when prices were much lower peakdemand in august was lower than in august of either of the prior twoyears negating representations by industry leaders that excessive demandcaused these price increases indeed some california electricity producerswere only running at of capacity during the socalled emergency periods these price hikes have even been effect during the middle of thenight when electricity is abundant and demand is low further prices innovember when demand for electricity is much lower than during thesummer months continue to be substantially in excess of the prior yearslevels and in excess of the levels that should prevail in a competitivemarketplace as a result of defendants exercise of market power theyartificially increased prices to record levels and have obtained hugewindfall profits as reported in the october san diego uniontribune analyst anatol feygin of jp morgan estimated that electricityindustry profits from california for the months ended september could reach billion even after taking into account cost increasesfeygin stated the industry was literally at eight times the profitabilityof last year that is a fortune defendant reliant has reported that its third quarter earnings willtop last years figure by about million similarly defendant dynegyreported an percent increase in its third quarter income ascompared to its third quarter figures profits from defendantdynegys wholesale energy generating and trading division quadrupled to million which represented percent of dynegys overall profitsthis is the most successful quarter in dynegys history reported chairmanand chief executive officer charles chuck watson other defendants alsoobtained large windfall profits during this period prior to deregulation the historical cost to produce a megawatthour of electricity in san diego county was approximately per mwhduring the summer of defendants conduct caused the real time marketprice of wholesale electricity to frequently reach per mwh resultingin an approximate tripling of sdge customers bills in its order issued on november ferc concluded thatwholesale prices of electricity in california had been at unjust andunreasonable levels during the summer of caiso and cpuc responses tothe november st ferc order both concluded that wholesale prices duringsummer were due to a substantial exercise of market power by generatorsand traders plaintiffs and the class were injured by the manipulated andinflated prices paid for wholesale electricity including retail customersof sdge since costs were fully passed through to them the cpucs november report to ferc concluded that the exercise of market power bywholesale producers resulted in a billion dollar overcharge for thedelivery of electricity to california during the summer of due to theunlawful conduct alleged above plaintiffs and the class paid approximately billion dollars more for electricity than they otherwise would havecausing great hardship to numerous individuals and businesses ascongressman brian bilbray stated every day that goes by youve got smallbusinesses bleeding to death people are literally dying financially fromthis situation workcom newswire the improper sharing and use of real time wholesale electricitygeneration and transmission data by defendants to withhold generation byunplanned outages and to maintain bidding strategies which led to contrivedand artificial shortages and other manipulative conduct had the effect ofartificially inflating and maintaining wholesale

it is not approving a cap on sellers prices because they can sell at whatever price they want rather iso has simply stated the maximum price it is willing to pay because sellers are not required to sell to the iso the iso cannot dictate their priceimportantly however ferc also states that iso has no more or less ability to procure capacity and energy than any other buyer of these servicesif the iso is unable to elicit sufficient supplies at or below its announced purchase price ceiling because generators are free to sell elsewhere if they choose it will have to raise its purchase price to the level necessary to meet its needs emphasis added ferc then notes that this may lead to an increase in out of market oom calls and that oom calls are not subject to a maximum purchase pricealso with regard to the isos resolution stating that generators must bid their capacity into the iso markets when system load exceeds mw ferc states clearly that such a requirement is not permitted by our november order and the iso tariff emphasis addedferc goes on to say that any requirement to sell to iso in conjunction with a maximum purchase price would require significant revisions to isos market rules which could not be made effective without a corresponding amendment to isos tariff this would require days advance notice and could not be implemented prior to commission approval as stated above our november order was clearly based on the premise that the proper response to inadequate supply due to a low maximum purchase price is to raise the maximum purchase priceiso is then put on notice that any amendment to mandate sales must be accompanied by a demonstration that this extreme measure is the proper response to low supplies in the iso marketsconcurrences were filed by commissioners massey and hebert massey suggests that the state has to facilitate solutions to market issues such as risk management tools removing constraints on hedging opportunities introducing real time pricing through real time metering and expediting approval of new generation and transmission projects in california hebert says that the previous november order tried to straddle the fence and that today the commission at least starts to lean slightly in the right direction of recognizing that we have a role he then reiterates his preference for removing all price caps he also suggests that getting to the bottom of the problem in my view requires us to begin a proceeding to rescind our approval of the iso as operator of the california grid the record supports such a move he refers approvingly to the collins resignation letter stating that it thoughtfully outlines consequences to the market of a return to command and control hebert states that the independence of the isos governing structure stands threatened we should stand up to quote the resignation letter hebert advocates opening a section proceeding now as part of the recently announced inquiry into bulk power markets including the california marketsthis decision makes it clear that iso cannot lower the caps at tomorrows meeting and expect that sellers will be required to sell to it at that price this is an important development and very good news in our ongoing efforts to seek economic sanity at the isoplease call if you have any questionsdan

tobelieve that an impartial trial cannot be had therein ccp o bthe party requesting a change of venue must show actual widespreadprejudice extending over a long period of time nguyen v superior court cal app th whether such a showing has been made isleft to the discretion of the trial court id case law provides little guidance regarding how much evidence isenough for a party to show actual prejudice as witkin states thischallenge is so vague and difficult to sustain witkin cal procedureactions o th ed in fact a change of venue on these groundshas been granted in very few reported cases the most recent of which was in see people v ocean shore rr cal app d sanjoaquin and kings river canal and irrigation co v stevinson cal ocean shore was an eminent domain proceeding against defendantland owners to acquire lands to build a state highway one defendantsmotion for change of venue was granted people v ocean shore rr calapp d the defendant filed nearly affidavits whichreferenced newspaper articles reports from civic meetings and statementsby citizens showing a widespread prejudice against the defendants and itscause extending over a long period of years id at the courtaffirmed the trial courts discretion noting that the affidavits show thatit would at least make it extremely doubtful whether an impartial trialcould be had before a jury in that county id at san joaquin was a condemnation action for the use of waters of ariver for the benefit of landowners on the west side of the river sanjoaquin and kings river canal and irrigation co v stevinson cal in that action the defendant operated an irrigation system for thebenefit of the landowners on the east side of the river plaintiff filedone affidavit showing that the people on the east side of the river feltwidespread prejudice against plaintiff and people on the west side of theriver were disqualified as jurors because they were using defendantsirrigation system id at defendant filed affidavits inopposition according to the court if numbers of affiants or ofaffidavits were the determining factor in questions of this character thedefendant herein would have been entitled to prevail upon said motion but this is not the rule id at rather the question is whether thetrial court abused its discretion and the court held that it did not these cases are contrasted with two case reported since inwhich change of venue motions were denied see riverside county floodcontrol and water conservation dist v joseph w wolfskill co calapp d nguyen v superior court cal app th riverside county was an eminent domain proceeding where plaintiffwas seeking to condemn property for the purposes of flood controldefendants moved for a change of venue by presenting evidence that theadvantages of the flood control project was widely publicized thenewspapers portrayed defendants as trying to prevent flood controls thatthe cost of purchasing defendants property was to come from county fundsand therefore every taxpayer was adverse to defendant cal app d at plaintiffs affidavit contradicted these facts the trial courtdenied the motion and this decision was affirmed on appeal id at in nguyen the state brought a suit against business owners in orderto shut down a red light district in san mateo the defendant businessesmoved for a change of venue defendants evidence consisted of twonewspaper articles reporting the raid on the businesses that the city spentover investigating and one affidavit of an employee of defendantslawyer the trial court denied the motion because the evidence fell farshort of proving actual prejudice cal app th at moreoverthe trial was to be a court trial not a jury trial and defendants showedno prejudice by the court id ross v kalin cal app although an extreme caseexemplifies that a change of venue motion most likely requires a highstandard of proof in ross plaintiffs motion for change of venue wasdenied plaintiff filed numerous affidavits in which uncontroverted factsshowed that as a result of plaintiffs crusade against vice conditions inthe city of venue plaintiff was assaulted by a mob beaten tarred andfeathered and chained to a tree id at the local newspaperpublished editorials approving the mob action id plaintiffs attorneywas also assaulted and beaten and banned from two organizations id ofthe to potential jurors between and were prejudicedagainst the plaintiff at some point in time id at the appellatecourt affirmed holding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion infinding that this prejudice

the ferc issued an order that appears to approve the isos request in full bullet summary of the isos amendment no december filing the following is a summary of the filing made by the iso isos mwh soft cap a summarized iso claims its proposal is identical to the ferc proposed so ft cap but raises the soft cap level to from the mwh proposed by the ferc the iso would replace the current cap on imbalance energy bids wi th an interim soft price cap based on the price mitigation proposal in th e commissions november order the isos scheduling system will not r eject energy bids priced in excess of the mwh price cap but will evaluate those bids in price merit order however if the iso issues dispatch instructions to scheduling coordinators for energy that has been bid in excess of the soft cap those bids will not set the market clearing price for imbalance energy rather those scheduling coordinators will be paid in accordance with their bids b refund risk and cost documentation above imbalance energy abov e the level of the soft price cap would be subject to refund based on subsequent review by the commission it also should require scheduling coordinators th at submit such bids to supply supporting cost information to the commission a s well as to the iso and to the california electricity oversight board so tha t they may bring questionable bids to the commissions attention i appears to imply that the proposed reporting requirement is supplemental to what was requested by the ferc see p ii regarding production costs fuel taxes emission credits startup cos ts are all listed as costs however no mention of noncontiguous scheduling costs or reasonable profit iii quasi safe harbor on opportunity costs in a footnote to cover letter iso states it will particularly scrutinize any opportunity costs in excess of of the production costs or mwh whichever is lesser c useful quote in light of current fuel prices and the isos recen t experience in receiving less than a thousand mw of imbalance energy bids at prices of or less in many hours the iso believes that a soft cap would be tantamount to procuring all imbalance energy on an asbid basis d effective date pm pst e term of this soft cap lesser of mo or whenever the commissi on supercedes it by its own order f applicable tariff sections section and see attachments ab to the filing participating generator penalties a summary the iso proposes in amendment no to assess penalties ag ainst participating generators that refuse to operate in response to an iso dispatch instruction during a system emergency or when the iso is acting to avoid an imminent or threatened system emergency they would be charged an amount equal to twice the highest price that the iso paid for energy for ea ch hour in which the participating generator failed to respond in addition i f during that hour the iso curtailed load to manage a system emergency other than load that has not been designated by agreement or regulation as interruptible the participating generator would pay an additional penalty of mwh for the energy that it failed to deliver b allowed excuse the penalties would not apply if the participating generator has notified the iso within the hour of instruction and subsequently demonstrates documentation within hours that its generating unit system unit or system resource was physically unable to operate or that operation would violate a legal restriction that could not be waived c applicable tariff sections amends portions of and see attachments ab to the filing d effective date same as the

califnoticepdf deccaorderpdfdan watkiss analysis of ferc order re penalties for refusal to sell energy last friday the iso filed with ferc amendment no to its tariffamong other things the amendment adds to the section of the tariff newprovisions empowering the iso to assess a penalty against participatinggenerators that refuse to operate in response to an iso dispatch instructionduring a system emergency or when the iso is acting to avoid an imminent orthreatened system emergency the penalty is stiff a charge for eachmwh of the dispatch instruction with which the participating generator doesnot comply equal to twice the highest price for energy per mwh paid ineach hour by the iso to any other entity to produce energy and if theiso is required t call for the involuntary curtailment of firm load tomaintain applicable reliability criteria during the system emergency thenan additional charge equal to for each mwh of the dispatchinstruction with which the participating generator does not comply theonly defense to these penalties is to provide proof that the generating unitin question was physically incapable of running or it would have violatedstate or federal law to run it eg air emission allowance limits theiso asked ferc for an immediate effective date of december which fercgranted in a december order the iso tariff defines participating seller or generator to meana generator or other seller of energy or ancillary services through ascheduling coordinator over the iso controlled grid and which has undertakento be bound by the terms of the iso tariff if enron is a participatinggenerator mary hain informs me that enron is not one then it risksincurring the new penalty if it fails to respond to an iso order to sellancillary services to the iso i believe enron might also risk incurringthe penalty in cases where it controls or has rights to all or a portion ofa generating capacity of a participating generators unit if that capacityis called on and the call is not answered because enron is making some otheruse of the capacity the enron may incur the penalty this seems to becontemplated by section of the participating generator agreement whichobliges a participating generator to comply with the tariff section byidentifying the generating units that it owns operates or has a contractualentitlement to in schedule as required by section of the iso

on friday governor gray davis issued the following statementthe federal energy regulatory commission has abdicated its responsibilityto the people in the west their responsibility is to ensure just andreasonable rates insteadthey have chosen to ensure unconscionable profits for the pirate generatorsand power brokers who are gouging california consumers and businessesmake no mistake by its unwarranted actions today ferc itself hassubstantially raised consumer electricity rates in california i urge thepublic utilities commissionto take all appropriate action to cushion the impact of this fercprovokedrate increase but by refusing to impose regional price caps and by seekingto deny californiacontrol over the independent system operator ferc has sided againstcalifornia consumers and businessesthis is an inexplicable decision by armchair washington bureaucrats fixatedon economic ideology that has no practical application to the dysfunctionalenergy market incalifornia and the west instead of acting in the best interests ofconsumers and businesses the ferc commissioners have acted as pawns ofgenerators and powersellers whose only interest is to plunder our economyfercs failure to act in the interest of our consumers and businessesliterally invites california to act to regain control over the energymarket given this decisioncalifornia now must move forward on both legal and legislative fronts toassure stabilization generation and conservationalthough we had hoped ferc would shoulder its responsibility we have notstood by idly waiting for them to rescue california already we have takenthe first stepsby encouraging the construction of new generation in californiathe energy commission has approved eight new power plants since april another is on the agenda for action next week twentytwo more applicationsarepending and the governors green team is working to accelerate permittingwere working closely with the california air resources board and local airdistricts to find solutions to emissions problems last week we were ableto put megawatts of power back online to help us through the current crisis andwell do moreweve refocused longidle energy conservation programs to save electricityand weve added million from the states general fund to getconservation programsonline by this summer the state under the guidance of the secretary of thestate and consumer services agency and the department of water resources hasbeencontributing up to megawattsaday to the conservation efforts ofconsumers and businesses throughout the state large industrial users haveborne a particularlyheavy burden through their interruptible contractsnow in response to fercs failure to meet its obligations i will call thecalifornia legislature into concurrent special session to do at least thefollowing replace the socalled stakeholders on the iso board withcalifornians who are more concerned about the prices consumers and businesses pay for power than they are about the profitstheir companies make reestablish the authority for the state to inspect privatepower plants to assure the coordination of maintenance and operating schedules last week alone more than megawatts ofpower were offline with half of that in unscheduled outages provide lowinterest financing for new peaking facilities orrepowering old ones to make them cleaner and more efficient in return for committing their power to californians atguaranteed low rateswe also need to work together to conserve energy we must quickly developprograms that large industrial and commercial companies can participate inthat arereasonable and predictablewe must redouble our efforts to educate and involve consumers inconservation efforts that will save energy and moneyi will be reserving billion in my january budget for thesepurposeswe also must ensure that there is enough electricity generation built incalifornia to get us through the current crisis and to allow the continuinggrowth of our economywe need to continue the efforts started under ab through the governorsgreen team to site new generation and to repower old dirty power plantswith newcleaner more efficient equipment making a dirty power plant clean can alsoimprove its efficiency by percentwe need to explore new opportunities to produce power through thedepartment of water and power hydroelectric power generated by the statewater project hashelped us through the crisis of the last few weeksand we need to encourage the development of cogeneration and distributedgeneration for businesses throughout californiafinally we need to find a way to stabilize electricity rates for allcalifornians that does not bankrupt our utilities but at the same timekeeps the pressure on the utilitiesand the pirate generators and power brokers to keep prices down there willbe pain but everyone must share that paina critical step to making this happen is to stop the bleeding that isoccurring even today as the greed of the generators and marketeers threatensour economytoward that end i am asking the attorney general to expand hisinvestigation to include civil and criminal violations that may haveoccurred in relation to

copy of my email to the california ag describing ouragreement re preservation of datarich as promised here is my summary outline of what we discussedregarding preservation of data in portland we proposed to handle business email related to thetopics in your preservation letter by instructing employees not to deleteany email sent or received for hours email that is personal and doesnot relate to the business topics you have identified can be kept discardedetc at the employees pleasure each day there is a backup made that willcapture the email in those employees mailboxes after hours eachemployee is free to manage their email box as they deem appropriate to thebusiness needs eg keep discard from our conversation i understandthat you agree that this is an acceptable procedure with respect to the hard drives on individual computers you wouldlike to get an organizational chart for portland that would enable us todiscuss individuals computers that would be copied using proquestdrive image pro in addition there may be some other individuals thatyou would like to have us use a software product called robocopy to copyfiles from their hard drives onto the network until we figure out whichcomputers to copy etc we will not begin this process we discussed thatbecause of the holiday period it may not be practical to get this starteduntil after the new year outside of portland we have proposed making a snapshot backup alongbusiness function lines reasonably called for by the subject matter of yourrequest we propose not to backup any other business units or functionson a going forward basis those business functions that related to thesubject matter of your request would be instructed not to delete businessemail we believe that relevant database backups have been and willcontinue to be made and preserved when an employee runs out of hard disk space on their computer itis an acceptable practice to copy files form their hard disk to the networkwhere they will be backed up and then delete those copied files to makesufficient work space for the employee to work for ees i explained that their it services are outsourced so we donot have as detailed information immediately availableas i mentioned on the phone all of these discussions and efforts being madeare done without waiving any objections that any of the enron entities mayhave to your request including scope burden jurisdiction relevanceprivilege privacy vagueness etc and enron specifically reserves each andevery right and objection it or its employees may haveplease let me know if your general understanding of our conversation isdifferent than the abovecpuc subpoena jeff richter and tim belden have been working on getting the epmidata correctly gathered they hope that by the middle of next week theenron technical types will have figured out where all the data is and haveassembled it for production because jeff richter will be gone until afterthe new year we will not be producing any data to the cpuc until early nextyear jeff and tim are focused on having a common set of reliable datathat will be used for all subpoenas discovery requests etc we alsodiscussed once we have the data collected that we use one of our experts tohelp with the analysis so that we are not creating files and records forwhich we will need to claim a privilege at a later point in time in otherwords since we are keeping the backup tapes for the systems in portland anyanalytical work that tim or jeff do for us will be recorded on the backuptapestim belden fyi tim and his wife are expecting their first child with a due dateof december th he will become out of pocket for a short time thereafterferc reporting a question arose regarding whether enron needed to file a report toferc concerning sales out of market that exceeded the soft caps this was arequirement that was requested by the iso in an emergency application ondecember th the order granting the relief did not seem to include thereporting requirement the first cut at the data for the report showed thatenron made m over a weekend by buying power at and selling at a later cut at the data came up with a different answer when consulted bychristian yoder and steve hall i made the unilateral decision not to filethe report it was unclear whether we needed to do so and i had not seenand did not trust the data later dan watkiss confirmed that he believed wedid not need to file the report however beginning january th thisreport will have to be filed for sales over the soft cap since this reportrequires a breakdown of costs vs sales price it is the same data that thepuc has been requesting and we anticipate will be requested in thelitigation tim belden and jeff richter are working on a standard reportingmethodhiring of chief operating officer for iso tim belden has been approached by the current chief operatingofficer of the iso requesting a job apparently the coo and the current isoboard are not getting along the issue raised by tim to mark haedicke andrichard was whether they saw a problem with this hire one of the keyissues would be what was the business purpose for the hire obviouslyenron does not want confidential iso information from this person also ifthis person will be a witness in the litigation there is a risk that if histestimony would be favorable to enron it would be viewed as purchased onthe other hand if his testimony would not be favorable at a time when he wasemployed by enron that could be harmful there is also the question raisedwhether this is a bona fide request for employment or whether other motivescould be in play tim will be meeting with the coo on friday he hasinstructions to make sure that he is not given any confidential data andthat no commitment will be made then without consulting the litigation teampotential for criminal investigation the news of the investigation and all of our involvement has raisedquestions in the mind of some employees as to whether there is a risk ofpersonal liability for them civil or criminal i reported that all weknow is that there is an investigation under way by the california attorneygeneral we have no reason to believe right now that they are focused onenron or that enron or any employee is a target i said that at this stageof the investigation including our investigation we do not know enoughfacts to evaluate the risk for individual employees we have not reviewedthe trader tapes to know what has been said on those tapes if we learn offacts that are specific to an employee mark has asked that we notify himimmediately we did provide some of this same information to traders weinterviewed early in the processanalysis of epmi data i have taken a look at the deviation of the iso energy flow on adaily basis from its day ahead schedules and compared those deviations toepmis the source of the data is public information that was available todecision makers at the time the

iso__pricecaps ::::::>>>>>> re there is no christmas for ca new ferc filings here is another hefty iso filing that came in this week please let sue o r i know if you believe we should interveneprotest alan comnes summary of iso amendment filed december effective date expedited treatment requested protests due january need to confirm this filing in a nutshell the iso states that the purpose of the amendment is t o clarify certain issues associated with implementation of the new transmissi on access charge methodology it orginally proposed in amendment no according to the iso amendment has been accepted for filing suspended and set for hearing settlement negotiations are ongoing is enron a par ty to these settlements in addition the iso provides new transmission acce ss charge tac rates that will be in effect if the commission approves the ci ty of vernon joining the iso effective january and the amount of firm transmission rights that will be given to vernon in accordance with the iso tariff specific proposed changes clarification of wheeling access charge quantity the iso proposes that these provisions be clarified to specify that in the determination of the wheeling access charge the proper calculation is to u se transmission facility ownership and entitlements less all encumbrances encumbrances include transmission used to meet demands of existing contracts this is how the iso is currently calculating this charge and th e iso appears to be using this filing to codify this method new hv tac rates using year of the isos proposed transmission methodo logy the current access charge methodology consists of three separate zone rates based on the transmission revenue requirement of the original participating to because each zone corresponds to the service territory of the to they are known as license plate rates under amendment no this met hodology continues in effect until a new participating to joins the iso once that occurs the access charge for high voltage transmission facilities will be assessed based on the combined high voltage transmission revenue requiremen ts of all the participating tos in each tac area the filing claims to implement an alreadyapproved transition formula where in new members of the iso will pay a rate that is a mix license place and syst em average embedded costs the goal is that after years there will be only high voltage access charge the following table shows that under the curren t method which would be a split of licenseplatesystemaverage charge s pge and sce to access charges would rise approximately million and vernon would be subsidized approximately million calculation of the net benefitsburdens from access charge and gmc impact pge and sce have a million cap annually and sdge has a million cap annually vernon is held harmless i ous pay muni cost increases in proportion to their cap relative to the tota l capadjusted net benefit burden pge sce sdge vernon total note a positive number means the tac is going up a negative number me ans the tac is going down or will be lower than would be the case under license plate ratemaking vernons existing transmission rights converted to ftrs veron by joining the iso effective agrees to convert existing transmission rights to ftrs of presumably an equivalent amount the propos ed ftrs to allocate to vernon are in the filing these ftrs will expire when the underlying contract right expires or years whichever is sooner susan j maraenron pm to richard shapironaenronenron james d steffesnaenronenron joe hartsoecorpenronenron sarah

icarterelectriccom jbarthropelectriccom cc efeomilbankcom kwongmilbankcom amarksmilbankcom subject commission hearings on rate stabilization plansyou are undoubtedly aware of the critical energy situation in california among other things the ferc has issued an order for the restructuring of the wholesale market and the california puc is continuing hearings on rate relief for the investor owned utilities and other issues we are monitoring the hearings in both washington and california and advising our friends and clients as developments occur the following is our most recent reporthearings on pges and sces rate stabilization plans continued on friday with testimony by walter campbell director of business and financial planning at pge who presented pges prima facie case and james asseltine managing director at lehman brothers who testified as to pges financial condition president lynch attended the hearings in the morning i understand that the republican appointed commissioners are on vacation and have been noticeably absent from the hearings hearings will continue on tuesday january with testimony from edison also on tuesday an all party meeting will be held with commissioner wood presumably for the purpose of facilitating settlement negotiations on thursday december governor davis facilitated a similar meeting between the utilities and consumer groups with little progress the commission meeting is scheduled for thursday january at which time the commission is expected to issue a final order a copy of the final order may be posted on the commissions website at wwwcpuccagov minutes prior to the meetingpge is requesting an end to the rate freeze an explicit statement that procurement costs are recoverable in rates from retail customers surprisingly mr campbell indicated that rate recovery on a going forward basis from the october or november billing periods may be a survivable outcome for pge this was later downplayed on redirect examination a meaningful rate increase mr campbell indicated that pge would be satisfied with a increase in rates follow up means of subsequent rate increases mr campbell indicated that customers could expect rate increases totaling up to over the next two years depending on market conditionssce who will be crossexamined on tuesday is asking for a larger rate increasean average of immediately to be followed by an undetermined number of rate hikes over the next two yearsthe following facts came out in the crossexamination of pge pge recovered billion in its transition cost recovery account during the transition period pge transferred billion during the transition period to its parent pge paid dividends of during the transition period pge paid a dividend of million in october when it knew as soon as june that it was amassing a huge underrecovery of its procurement costs for the th quarter pges parent has declared a dividend a legal obligation of the parent pge has not determined whether to declare a dividend pges parent has approximately million in cash which it could use to pay its declared dividend of the parent companys revenues came from pge in pge projects a borrowing need of billion in the first quarter of pge will not have sufficient cash to purchase gas or electricity within to weeks pge has not attempted to borrow from its parent and its parent has little or no borrowing power there is not enough time for its parent to consider selling assets of other subsidiaries pge is fully borrowed under its commercial paper programs and bank lines pge has not considered cutting back executive salaries parent company subsidiaries made million on power trading in western markets on tuesday pge will report on its generation revenues mr campbell indicated that approximately of the undercollections could be netted out by the generation revenues by the end of the year pge estimated that its undercollections will total more than billion based on the last several days i believe that the commission is very reluctant to declare an end to the rate freeze particularly if this means that the commission will lose rate control over the hydro assets alternatively i believe that president lynch feels that she has the necessary statutory authority to order interim emergency rate relief subject to refund in this regard in the last day of hearings i believe that pge met its burden of establishing an emergency condition which will allow the commission to act on an emergency basisseveral months ago at an industry conference where commissioner wood spoke he indicated that he felt his only responsibility under the law was to consumers thus i would expect commissioner wood to be on the low end on the percentage of rate increase allowed he does not seem to concerned about the utility entering bankruptcy loretta lynch takes her cue from governor davis and governor davis has publicly stated that a rate increase may be reasonable commissioner neepers term ends sunday and he will not vote on the order as mentioned above commissioners duque and bilas have been noticeably absent from these proceedings in any event given the way president lynch controls the commission you can expect her view to prevail and rate increases to be more in the range of i also believe that commissioner wood and president lynch are inclined to find that the utilities undercollections to date are a risk they assumed under ab it is possible that the commission will allow the recovery of past undercollections but would net out the undercollections with its generation revenuesas far as subsequent rate increases on a going forward basis president lynch has indicated that she is only willing to consider the issues which must be decided on an emergency basis she will likely reject any attempt by the utilities to obtain rate relief on an emergency basis for periods which could be the subject of a full rate hearingplease feel free to contact me at or

jonesnow that pge corp pcg edison international eix and sempra energy sre have announced that about billion in power costs flew out their windows this summer wall street might be curious to know on which corporate doorsteps the windfall landed a few of the beneficiaries have indicated publicly how well they did this summer weve supplemented those announcements with data on market share conversations with western us electricity traders second quarter earnings reports and publicly available information from the california independent system operator operator of the states highvoltage transmission grid and realtime power market to create this top list of winners in the summer of luck no duke energy corp duk calpine corp cpn and aes corp aes these companies with significant merchant power plants in california didnt make as much money as they could have because they sold their power before prices started rising aes for starters has sold the vast majority of the capacity of its california naturalgas fired generators under a longterm fixedprice contract to make power for another company a company much higher on this list which supplies the natural gas and owns the electricity duke with megawatts of generators in california lost out on significant potential income because it sold most of its power months before prices started to rise no electricity trading companies these companies like utilicorp uniteds ucu aquila citizens power now owned by edison international and belgian company tractebels btrb us unit mostly traded in and out of positions and they made good profits doing so this group also includes the unregulated trading units of sempra and pge no western utilities with power to spare namely arizona public service co the public service co of new mexico pnm and idacorp incs ida idaho power pnm said on sept that it made million in wholesale marketing during july and august a increase over the same two months last year arizona public service which is a subsidiary of pinnacle west capital corp pnw had considerably more power to sell than pnm market sources said no transalta tta and ppl global ppl western electricity prices have been high outside california as well transalta and ppl reached deals to buy two major coalfired power plants in the northwest last year and took ownership before this summer unlike gas coal is still cheap no enron corp ene el paso energy epg and the energy trading unit of morgan stanleydean witter mwd unlike the inandout traders these companies bet on rising prices and came into the summer holding large supplies in the west electricity traders said enron just bought and bought and bought before the summer and never seemed to sell said one trader el paso also owns mw of generation in california no the us federal government and the state of arizona federal utility bonneville power administration and arizona public utility salt river project rode to californias rescue on the hottest days this summer providing hundreds of megawatts of supply at top dollar no californias independent generators the merchant power companies in california that did the best this summer are reliant energy inc rei with about mw of california capacity southern co so with about mw nrg energy nrg with mw and dynegy inc dyn with mw unlike duke aes and calpine these companies held on to most of their power and sold it in the dayahead and realtime markets where prices turned out to be best reliant has already indicated that third quarter earnings available for equity will top last years figure by about million all of these companies however saw their windfall trimmed by diversification each owns gasfired and some oilfired merchant power plants in the eastern us where high fuel prices and low electricity prices have damped profits weve had a good summer but we have a pretty balanced portfolio across the country stephen bergstrom president and chief executive of dynegy said in an interview as good as the summer has been in the west its been as bad in the eastern half of the country no los angeles dept of water power and its bondholders ladwp has about mw of generation or about mw more than it needs for its customers as ladwp general manager s david freeman said a few weeks ago a blind pig could make money with that setup no the heavily taxed citizens of british columbia canada their provincially owned utility bc hydro has been very busy this summer turning free water into electricity worth hundreds of millions of dollars more than expected and flooding the provinces general funds with hydroelectric dam reservoirs the size of new england and transmission lines that can carry mw of southbound power bc hydro has singlehandedly kept socialism solvent for another year in british columbia and the grand prize winner in the california utilities sweepstakes williams companies wmb the company aess generators are working for williams controls almost mw of gasfired generation in the san diego area a little more than of what californias utilities need on average during daylight hours in the summer whats more those plants are under contract as resource must run with the iso their power cant be sold in the forward market williams had to take daily and realtime market prices by default which is exactly what you would have done to maximize profits and williams isnt hurt by the factors that have diluted other companies california gains it isnt very exposed in the east and as a big producer of natural gas its benefiting from high gas prices nationwide just to give an idea of how well the company likely has done this summer consider that williams second quarter profit from its energy services segment rose to million this year from million in the second quarter of that in a quarter with

california according to a news article on february duke energy corpsuspended its lawsuit against gray davis and the state after the californiadepartment of water resources agreed to buy power from duke that wasformerly being provided under contracts with two financially troubleutilities originally duke argued that governor davis exceeded his authorityunder the emergency services act when he commandeered dukes longtermcontracts the case is suspended until an april hearing i am trying toobtain a copy of any order andor stipulation filed with the courtiso v reliant et al i brief summary of complaint in iso v reliant et al iso seeks a preliminary injunction torequire six reliant entities williams energy marketing trading four aesentities and dynegy power corporation collectively defendants toprovide generation in response to isos emergency dispatch instructions isos sole allegation is that because defendants submitted to theiso tariff by participating in the iso markets and by entering intoscheduling coordinator agreements and participating generator agreementsdefendants cannot refuse to generate in response to an emergency dispatchorder this allegation is based upon section of the tariff ii current status of the case february stipulationon february the parties entered a stipulation which states inrelevant part the reliant defendants williams and dynegycollectively generator defendants will comply with emergency dispatchorders of the california iso under the terms of the iso tariff withoutregard to whether iso allocates the cost of power produced in response tosuch a dispatch order to a creditworthy scheduling coorindator until theearlier of the following a pm pacific standard time on march or b two business days but in no event less than hours after written notice to this court and the parties by a generatordefendant that this stipulated obligation is terminated as to it notice of termination by a generator defendant ofits obligation under paragraph b shall not affect the stipulatedobligations or remaining generator defendants except that on receipt ofsuch notice each remaining generator defendant shall have the right to filewith the court an election terminating its obligation in the event of suchan election the obligation of a terminating generator defendant to complywith iso dispatch orders imposed by paragraph shall end hours afterwritten notice to iso of the election to terminate each terminatinggenerator defendant shall have the same right and status to participate inany legal proceedings that follow the initial notice of terminationincluding any appeal the motions heard by this court on february including isos motion for preliminary injunction reliants motion todismiss or stay pursuant to the ferc order and dwrs motion to dismissreliants third party complaint will be deemed submitted at pm onmarch or at pm on the day written notice of termination ofthe obligation stipulated in paragraph is filed with the court whicheveris earlier iii february th hearing below is a summary of the hearing held on february th in thereliant case which i initially prepared on saturday february th iapologize if you did not receive this earlier the hearing involved three motions a isos motion for preliminary injunction b reliants motion to dismiss or stay c dwrs motion to dismiss third party complaint judge damrell took each motion under submission and stated that he will issue an order on or before february at pm he ordered the february tro to remain in effect until then judge damrell clarified that the tro requires defendants to respond to all iso emergency dispatch orders edos regardless of the creditworthiness of the purchasers the judge encouraged defendants to stipulate that they would respond to iso edos and gave defendants until february to do so it appears that only aes is willing to do so at this timesummary isos motion for preliminary injunction and reliants motion to dismiss stay are linked in that they essentially relate to the same issue are generators obligated to respond to edos despite having no assurances that they will be paid ie assurances that a creditworthy purchaser will be buying the generation in response to the edo a reliants motion to dismiss or to stay reliants motion to dismiss or alternatively to stay was based solely upon a february ferc order conditionally adopting isos proposed amendment this ferc order as i understand it from the arguments allows iso to waive the creditworthy requirement only with respect to pge and sce scheduling of energy to meet their own load parsing the order reliant argued that the order implicitly means that the creditworthy requirement is not waived with respect to all other purchases including edos because of the ferc order reliant argued that isos complaint which seeks injunctive relief requiring defendants to respond to edos without assurances of creditworthiness should be dismissed alternatively reliant argued that because the proceeding before ferc continues the court should stay this case pending the outcome by ferc iso argued that according to the language of the ferc order ferc explicitly did not rule on the issue related to the application of the creditworthiness requirement to edos and a stay is improper because due to energy crisis iso cannot wait for ferc to decide this issue analysis judge damrell appeared very skeptical of reliants interpretation of the order he asked if ferc intended that the creditworthy requirements apply to edo why didnt it address it headon especially because the importance of this issue was raised by dynegy before ferc he questioned reliant about several sentences in the order which suggest that ferc explicitly did not decide the issue judge damrell is unlikely to stay the proceedings he stated that the exigencies of the situation are such that he perhaps he should not wait for ferc to rule he made several comments about how long it takes ferc to act and that the federal courts should step in times of crisis such as this b isos motion for preliminary injunction in support of its motion for a preliminary injunction to require defendants to provide generation in response to edos iso argued as follows defendants submitted to the iso tariff by participating in the iso markets and by entering into scheduling coordinator agreements and participating generator agreements section of the tariff obligates defendants to respond to edos edos are essential to keep the lights on and because the decision to issue edos are made only in times of emergencies the iso does not look at who the purchaser is is not required to by the tariff and should not be required to because of the current energy crisis defendants argued that they need not respond to an edo without assurances that they would be selling to a creditworthy purchaser because the creditworthy requirement is an essential element of the tariff and a ferc order held that the creditworthy requirement applies even edos dynegy raised an additional argument iso and dwr are using the edo procedures to get a price below market and that there is no real threat that the lights will go out according to dynegy dwr can back real time purchases including edos but instead dwr backs only purchases at a certain price below market if generators refuse iso issues an edo with no assurances that the generators will get paid as a strong arm tactic to get this below market price dynegy argued that the reality is that the lights will not go out because if generators do not abide by the edos dwr has enough money to buy at market rate there would be no issue here if dwr would pay the just and reasonable rate for the electricity rather than using edo procedures to lower the rate and dwr can go to ferc if it believes that the rate is unjust and unreasonable analysis judge damrell certainly appeared to be leaning towards the iso he expressed his views that this case involves a narrow issue do the defendants have an obligation to respond to edos without assurances that it will get paid in this time of crisis his questions and comments suggest that he believes that the amount of energy subject to the edos is small and necessary to avert rolling blackouts he questioned mr detmer manager of operation of iso who suggested that about of purchases at peak are made through edos judge damrell was not very sympathetic towards dynegys argument asking are you was saying that dwr iso and the state are the cause of the crisis several times judge damrell stated that he thought the high wholesale prices caused the crisis according to judge damrell the simple fact is you got rich and the utilities went broke also as noted above judge damrell does not believe that waiting for ferc to make decisions is the proper course in the current energy crisis because ferc does not act quickly enough c dwrs motion to dismiss rd party complaint reliant brought a third party complaint against dwr and dwr movedto dismiss as framed by the court the key issue is does th amendmentprohibit reliant from joining dwr in the case judge damrell asked aboutthe th amendment immunity argument stating that the issue was notthoroughly briefed the judge asked the parties to file supplemental briefson the issue i am obtaining a copy of these supplemental

iso__pricecaps ::::::>>>>>> fw lead story sunday sf chronicle heres what those of us in san francisco read sunday morning as the leadstory in the sf chronicle soaring electric use more fiction than fact chronicle investigation finds power companies manipulate data to excuse their towering rates christian berthelsen scott winokur chronicle staff writers mailtocberthelsensfchroniclecom sunday march san francisco chronicle chronicleinfocopyright url httpwwwsfgatecomcgibinarticlecgifilechroniclearchive mndtl power companies say it so often and with such certainty that it has become a virtual mantra skyrocketing energy use by californians is a root cause of the states power crisis and justification for surging electricity prices but a computer analysis of electricity usage data by the chronicle reveals that the mantra is a myth that overall growth in electricity demand hasnt been nearly as great as the industry portrays it the industry has painted the summer of as the equivalent of a year storm in meteorology an event so powerful and unexpected that the existing infrastructure was devastated by its force the statistics show that taken in total was nothing of the sort moreover two independent state agencies assessments of californias power plant capacity appear to show that the growth should have been easily accommodated the companies have defended their practice of increasingly taking power generation plants out of service by arguing that heavy demand and consequent plant usage necessitated major timeconsuming repairs the claims that demand growth is rampant and that it was totally unexpected and due to the internet economy to silicon valley or server farms or people recharging cell phones thats bogus said tom kelly assistant executive director of the california energy commission about as bogus as you can get the chronicles findings are based on data collected by the california independent system operator a manager of the states electricity grid they show total electricity consumption in california increased only percent in from a sharp contrast to claims of industry representatives who have repeatedly relied on isolated loose or selective comparisons that make growth appear as high as percent in fact the single greatest hour of electricity usage in was actually lower than any peak demand period in or average peak demand the average of the highest hour of electricity usage for each day increased only percent from to even during the months of may to september in when the greatest spikes in electricity usage occur demand growth was only percent higher than the same period the year before more than days of critical power shortage warnings socalled stage emergencies and two days of blackouts this year occurred at times of moderate energy use levels often below those at which neither warnings nor blackouts have occurred in the past the findings appear to buttress suspicions that the skyrocketing demand explanation for rising energy prices is a cover for what is really happening that power companies have simply started charging more for an essential commodity regardless of whether it is in short supply presented with the chronicles findings gary ackerman a representative for the western power trading forum a trade group representing power companies said the calculations support the industry position that electricity demand is growing strong thats pretty healthy growth for california as opposed to the longterm historical average which is close to percent he said to me thats really strong growth energy demand is certainly on the rise in california growth of more than percent is still double what was projected and the state has obviously fallen behind in building power plants even though a recent study found california ranked th out of the states in percapita energy consumption the surging demand explanation has become so accepted that leading officials accept it as gospel gov gray davis has made energy conservation percent at that a centerpiece of his efforts to solve the crisis energy use is growing said state sen john burton dsan francisco citing the growth of silicon valley and hightech operations statewide theres been tremendous growth whether manufacturing or high tech cell phones faxes whatever the stuff is growing yet the energy industry has been steadfast in its insistence that the consumer is largely to blame in testimony and submissions to government bodies considering prescriptions for the crisis energy demand growth has consistently been overstated joe bob perkins the chief operating officer of houstonbased reliant energy inc told the us senate in january that californias growing economy and high summer temperatures caused electricity use to surge dramatically a demand growth of percent richard wheatley a spokesman for reliant said perkins testimony was based on estimates by the federal energy information administration of monthly retail electricity sales we do stand by that wheatley said unfortunately it does not track with iso data the industrybacked edison electric institute said in a report that electricity demand grew by anywhere from percent to percent during the spring of compared with the same period a year earlier russell tucker an economist for the institute said the groups figures were derived by identifying the single highest hour of electricity demand for each spring month of and and comparing them finding the may peak rose percent granted the state energy commission uses the same model to determine whether california has enough plant capacity to meet demand but the presentation makes it appear that overall demand not just the absolute peak is growing by percent when the peak of each day is averaged and compared from year to year mays figure was much lower percent also nowhere did edisons report note that the peak hour of a load of megawatts on aug was actually lower than the peak hours of either of the previous two years on july or on sept the chronicle analysis of average peak demand showed that no month last year grew more than junes percent though no blackouts occurred in that month may and june were the only months when demand growth exceeded percent the analysis showed most months recorded percent or percent and some such as september were less than percent two months october and december had demand levels lower than the year before percent less for october percent lower for december mike florio a consumer lawyer and board member of the iso said that even growth of less than percent from to would seem overstated since was a relatively mild weather year and was a much hotter one you are quite right florio said skyrocketing demand is a myth market manipulation consumer representatives and some politicians have long suspected that rather than dire imbalances between supply and demand market manipulation is behind the crisis generators and power marketers adamantly deny this saying they have done everything they could to keep the lights on they say they ran aging decrepit plants at higherthannormal levels last summer to accommodate what they described as unprecedented demand they also say that at great expense they delayed muchneeded maintenance in order to keep the power flowing their claims have received some support from the federal energy regulatory commission which said in a report last month that it found no evidence power companies were using maintenance schedules to manipulate supply the report however was heavily qualified by the ferc which said it did not investigate other forms of manipulation moreover the agency acknowledged that the bulk of its investigation was conducted by simply calling power plants and questioning them over the telephone the supply side of the energy equation is harder to penetrate in part because supply data are confidential thus the question of how blackouts could have occurred at such low levels of demand in january is hard to answer what is clear is that at times during the crisis this year as much as megawatts of electricity supply have been unavailable for use mostly because of unplanned plant outages about four times the level anticipated by the iso power companies say the old plants they bought were not capable of producing to the levels sketched out by the iso and the energy commission and that everything from low water conditions emissions limitations and high temperatures last year caused less energy to be available than was anticipated but others suggest that what began as a shortage caused by a withholding of supply to drive up price has turned into one caused by withholdings out of fear of not being paid what did go up unquestionably were wholesale electricity prices while average electricity usage during the heaviest hours last year increased by less than percent prices charged by power companies to the utilities that deliver juice to consumers increased more than percent in june the cost of a megawatt hour increased more than fivefold going from the level of to in october prices doubled over the same period a year earlier going from to and in december despite a percent decline in electricity usage from the previous december peak wholesale electricity prices hit theyd been one year before then the pace of price increases began to accelerate within the last six months of overall average peak usage during december was about megawatts about a fifth lower than it was in august average prices in december they just about doubled to a megawatt hour the companies explanation for rising prices despite falling demand was that more and more plants had to be taken offline for repairs decreasing supply even given the high number of inoperable plants questions remain about why the existing supply could not cover demand on the blackout days of jan and fewer plants were offline and more electricity was available than on days when the state managed to squeeze by without turning out the lights even today with stage alerts having faded away at least temporarily demand levels remain more or less the same as when california was in a constant state of emergency moreover the lists of offline plants are as long as ever ample power should exist the energy commission and the iso have concluded that californias power plants are capable of generating more than megawatts of electricity that means that even with plant repair outages low water levels decreasing hydraulic generation airpollution rules and other environmental constraints the power companies should be able to accommodate all but the most extreme spikes in demand according to industry data obtained by the chronicle the western systems coordinating council a governmentbacked trade group in salt lake city concluded california would have considerable surpluses throughout including margins as high as percent in december based on data provided to it by the iso even under low water conditions the iso reported the state would have total power resources of megawatts in that month yet unplanned outages were far higher and the system began to crash that month and into this year at far lower levels of

iso__pricecaps ::::::>>>>>> california energy crisis californias power crisis has generated heated debate over the last seve ral months unfortunately this debate has generated more heat than light we want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on california energy issues what happened in california the source of californias current problem is as straightforward as supp ly and demand californias economy grew percent since this incr eased the demand for electricity by percent at the same time regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state so demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added the resul t predictably is a shortage this summer peak capacity will be about percent shy of peak demand leading to further blackouts in the state in addition to the supply and demand imbalance there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis first the states regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market the spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile the way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo ng term medium term and short term to reduce exposure to this volatility i n california state regulation prevented this strategy this would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th e most volatile interest rate environment imaginable everything was fine while the power surplus persisted but when shortages ensued every megawat t was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price second retail markets were not deregulated regulated retail rates remain ed in effect and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out this meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa le prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate they are now nearly bankrupt in short californias problems were caused by regulation not deregulat ion regulations prevented competitors from entering the market prevented new generation from being built and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot prices at the time california was developing its restructuring plan enron warned the states policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives w hich if adopted would have averted the current crisis enrons role many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f ix the problem power sellers including enron have been vilified by the politicians and the media here are the facts other than a small amount of wind power enron is not a generator in the state of california every megawatt we sold in california we bought in the same market available to other california purchasers because we are a market maker not a generator we are not biased toward high prices we ar e interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc ts for our customers as a seller to enduse markets in the state we provided protection from the problems the states utilities and their customers now face we protected and still protect our customers from price volatility you may have read that ees recently elected to have the utilities supply power directly to its customers in california instead of procuring power on the open market early reports mischaracterized this as a turnback of our customers to the utilities here are the facts as a result of a variety of factors existing in the current california market it made more sense for ees to source power for its customers direct ly from the utilities this decision reduced eess market price risk by allowing ees to access lower utility rates ees did not terminate any customer contracts and our customers continue to receive the financial benefits of their contract prices ees is continuing to work with its california customers to provide them with other energyrelated products and services including assistance in reducing the demand for power particularly at peak times enron is currently proposing solutions to help california work out of its crisis enron continues to sign up customers in the state and enron continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in western power markets enrons primary business is managing risk for our custom ers with solutions customized to meet their needs there has never been more demand for our products and services the solution the solution to californias crisis is also straightforward in summary the state must increase supply reduce demand reduce reliance on the spot mark et and shore up the financial stability of the states utilities increasing supply californias process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing short of byzantine enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les s than a year in california it often takes to years california simpl y must streamline this process ironically while many of the regulations generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality the regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and displacing current plants which emit times as much nox california can have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new facilities reducing demand customers in california today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand they pay the same rate no matter what the market price is an open retail market would trigger demand responses which would balance supply and deman d at lower prices than today california should fully open its retail market reducing reliance on the spot market in a truly deregulated market customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer term fixedprice basis the state has instead left procurement in the han ds of the utilities which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the ir price risk restoring the financial integrity of the states institutions the utilities in california are not paying their bills this has led to greater uncertainty in the market higher costs and reduced flexibility to arrive at lasting solutions california must permit its utilities to recov er their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is needed just as important as doing these things the state must avoid policies that while politically attractive do not fix the problem or even make matters worse price caps have been proposed they dont work have never work ed and they will not work here price caps succeed only in creating shortages which then have to be allocated among competing users imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining for example whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the imperial vall ey or silicon valley price caps are a surefire way to make the current shortage worse the state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in california there is no reason to believe and every reason to doubt that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in constructing operating and maintaining assets this will also result in california tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation which the private sector can do instead of education road s and other public goods which the private sector cannot do as you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t he crisis from the media its important for you to know this we at enron will continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real solutions to the state

groupfrom joe hartsoe regulatory affairs committee chair bob reilley power marketing working group chair julie simon vice president of policy erin perrigo senior manager of policydate re summary of the ferc staff recommendation on california market monitoring and mitigation and epsa comment outlinepursuant to its december order el december order ferc released its staff recommendation on prospective market monitoring and mitigation for the california wholesale electric power market report issued march th addressing mitigation of price volatility in the california markets comments on the report are due on thursday march nd the following is a summary of the report along with an outline of possible epsa comments we will discuss the report and epsas comments further on our weekly power marketers conference call to access the call dial and ask for the julie simonepsa call if you have any questions please feel free to contact erin perrigo at or eperrigoepsaorgreport summarystressing that the proposal is designed to apply only to approximately five percent of the market that remains in realtime and not to the bilateral and forward markets the report immediately notes that ultimately the real solution to californias problems lies in increased investments in infrastructurethe report recommends that the california iso conduct a realtime auction with associated measures to mitigate the impact of physical and economic withholding and significant exercises of market power during periods of scarcity coordinating and controlling outages the iso should coordinate and approve all planned outages by units that have a participating generator agreement pga with the iso coordination and outage control procedures should then be coupled with reporting requirements to ferc and dispute review should be expedited similarly the iso should closely monitor unplanned outages and report questionable outages to ferc for further investigation selling obligations all capacity that is available and not scheduled to run under sellers with pgas should be offered in the realtime market this obligation would not be imposed on bilateral markets of the iso dayahead markets pga generators would have to submit to ferc a dependable capacity for each unit in addition to other operating parameters necessary to calculate marginal costs such as heat rate ferc staff would then use this data in combination with published fuel costs and emission credit data to determine a price that the iso would use predetermined to mitigate prices during times of reserve deficiency load serving entities should also be required to name their curtailment price and to identify which loads will be curtailed price mitigation when called upon to provide the available and unscheduled capacity as mentioned above pga unit prices would be mitigated in hours when there is a reserve deficiency or stage emergencies the report notes that it is these hours which are extremely conducive to the exercise of market power by suppliers and will be obligated to sell capacity in realtime at the marginal cost of the highestpriced pga until called upon to run realtime price mitigation for each generating unit all generating units should have a standing confidential price based on its marginal costs this price will be used by the iso to establish the realtime market clearing price when mitigation is appropriate staff believes that a single market clearing price auction design is appropriate thus reversing the recommendation to use an as bid design in the december order market clearing price all realtime energy offers should be paid the applicable market clearing price conditions for invoking mitigation mitigation measures should only be applied to critical operating periods such as emergenciesas noted in the report staff recognizes that there are potential difficulties in implementing the proposal and that there are no easy answers to the current problems in the california market among the purported difficulties staff notes implementation problems with bidding obligations on imported power incentive effects on load scheduling treatment of purchased power mitigating prices during emergencies and setting a price component for scarcitysuggested epsa commentsepsa has a number of concerns with the proposal however there are a few things we commend namely the staffs timely turnaround of the report as directed in the december order their admission that the overarching problem cannot be solved by these shorterterm mitigation measures only by increased investments in infrastructure and recommendation of the single price auction in the realtime market noting that it should be used for only approximately five percent of the market also to stress the importance of regulatory certainty the report recommends a datecertain sunset for the mitigation approach of no more than one yearareas of concern include it is not acceptable to use a costbased model to explain what happens to prices in a shortage period the oil shortages of the s are a good illustration a nine percent cut in free world oil supplies led to the first quadrupling of oil prices from about to per barrel similarly prices rose to in with an eight percent reduction in free world oil supply staffs proposal for calculation of the market clearing price does not create a market clearing price in scarcity situations and does not take into account the customers value of the commodity to the extent sellers costs are used full costs are not included staffs recommendation as outlined in epsas recently filed white paper on market monitoring full costs should include opportunity costs scarcity value capacity value and risk the report fails to link high prices to any anticompetitive behavior yet still alleges such behavior throughout the report epsa opposes the forced bidding into the realtime market as recommended this prescription precludes and preempts competitive business decisions and retards the healthy development of the market the reports method for calculating the market clearing price is not illustrative of a true market and may create an artificial market clearing price the method proposed in fercs refund order of march th may be preferable to the method proposed in this report staffs method only includes participating generators and does not include imports and outofmarket purchases epsa prefers a method that is more inclusive of details and characteristics of a true market

changes needed for retroactive refundsfercs hoecker asks congress for broader authoritydate october ferc chairman james hoecker d told a congressional panel that the commission needs retroactive ratemaking authority to better guard against market power in a competitive environment hoecker also urged the congressmen to give the commission broader authority to sufficiently oversee the utility industrys transition to competitionhoeckers plea to congress may not be a welcomed one for california where some state officials want the commission to order refunds to customers after prices in the wholesale market skyrocketed to unprecedented levels this summer although hoecker has informed california that the commission will consider refunds as a part of its larger investigation into the states bulk power markets it is clear that currently the commission does not have that authority to do so retroactivelythe federal power act would have to be changed a ferc staffer saysfor its own study which began in august hoecker claimed that the commission if proven necessary would consider ordering refunds if market participants were indeed price gouging however the federal power act fpa the law that gives the commission much of its authority does not consider retroactive refund authority and clarification of that law is probably needed to see if the commission can do thatif we need to fix market rules or market structures within our jurisdiction we will do so hoecker told the house committee on government reform sept if market power is being exercised we will respond accordingly by revoking or modifying marketbased rates or reassuring the basis upon which we grant them we may order refunds to the extent allowed by the fpa if refunds are justified by record evidence however the fpa defines the commissions authority and leaves responsibility for many helpful measures with california and other statescurrently the fpa allows the commission to issue refunds for transactions made days after the commission initiates an investigation which in this case would be oct however the law makes no mention of retroactive ratemaking and ferc officials admit that to do so the law needs to be changedbased upon what i know the authority of the commission to issue refunds for any period before days following our investigation order is highly problematic commissioner william massey d told electric power alert there are very good arguments that if ferc would try to do that it would be unlawful and we would need legislation to do thatthe government reform committee chaired by rep dan burton rin held a midafternoon sept hearing to gauge what is being predicted to be a severe energy crisis this winter the committee heard testimony from hoecker energy secretary bill richardson and environmental protection agency epa administrator carol brownermuch of the hearing focused on natural gas and oil markets but both richardson and hoecker used the meeting as a forum to blast congress for failing to pass comprehensive restructuring legislation this year richardson expressed his disappointment that nothing passed while hoecker claimed that ferc needs broader authority if it is to guard against market powercongress should place all electric transmission in the continental united states under the same rules for nondiscriminatory open access and comparable service hoecker said the commissions open access rules are not binding on the part of the nations transmission system owned or controlled by entities other than public utilities open access over the facilities of public power and other nonpublic utilities would promote greater competition in wholesale markets by expanding trading opportunities for wholesale buyers and sellershoecker pointed to fercs investigation into bulk power markets and californias energy crisis and claimed that unless the commission receives clear legislative direction ferc will extremely limited in what it could do to solve the market problemscongress too has a role to play in ensuring that consumers are able to obtain the energy they need at reasonable prices hoecker said most critically events this summer demonstrate the urgency of enacting electricity legislation to help resolve remaining impediments to competition federal legislation can establish the ground rules that will lead to adequate investment in generation and transmission facilities and higher levels of reliability which is crucial to the digital economythe chairman also urged congress to give ferc the authority to mandate regional transmission organization participation and mandate reliability standards currently the house is considering a bill that would make the commission a federal backstop for reliability but most

weak evidence of forwardlookingdynamic pricing for a brief time in but not otherwise my impressionwas that the evidence for was very weak and the logic used to arriveat this conclusion was also weakpuller then went at this a second time with a theory that attempts todetermine what a firms supply function would look like if it wasexercising static and dynamic market power and then comparing this to anestimate of that firms actual supply function i found this even morespeculative than the first theory nonetheless the results are basicallythe same evidence of static but not dynamic market powerpuller took a lot of heat for the methodology of this paper during thequestioning segment hes not a dynamic speaker and does not appear to meto be a strong expert candidateanjali sheffrins commentary was very important she is the director ofmarket analysis for caiso after general comments on crespo and puller shelaunched in to a discussion of whether their models explained the californiaexperience this turned out to be a preview of the caiso ferc filing oflast week in which they allege billion in market powerrelatedovercharges from may to feb that filing and sheffrins reportfollow they are essential reading pdfpdf pdfpdfsheffrin maintains that it was the absence of imports during this periodthat left the market power of the california generators unchecked thispermitted the instate generators to engage in either economic or physicalwithholding of power economic withholding is bidding a higherthanneededsupply curve physical withholding is cutting output at the plant herstudy was intended to identify individual firms engaging in market poweractivity and analyze how each firms actions set market clearingprices she utilized full bidding data in ca iso real time market foreach hour between may and nov defined and categorized bidding patternsand identified economic or physical withholding and then calculatedbidcost markup and a monopoly rent she found what she claimed was strongevidence of both types of withholding but that economic withholding is thedominant bidding pattern used by the five large california generatorswhile sheffrins study does not name names it claims that most of the fiveinstate suppliers and many of the large importers displayed biddingpatterns which were consistent with the exercise of market powerbernstein and himmelstein were positively gleeful during this presentationon the question of collusion sheffrins study is not terribly illuminatingshe maintains that the dominant bidding pattern is consistent with twocharacteristics of a supply function equilibrium model of oligopolistpricing i take that to mean cournot which is a static noncollusivemodel however when you read her study youll see the picture is notentirely clearlien the curse of market power this is only marginally relevant for usas its thesis is that forwardlooking supply contracts are better for bothproducers and society everyone seemed to agree and were confused why weneeded a paper to prove it lien u md is young and not expert materialjoskow and kahn httpwwwmitedupeoplepjoskowjkpaperrevisedpdfpaper httpwwwuceiberkeleyeduuceiconfslideskahnslidespdfkahns slides im sure many of you have already read this everyoneshould prepared for socal edison it contends that instate generatorsreliant dynegy aeswilliams and southernmirant exercised market powerby withholding capacity during the summer or jk use publicly available data on loads market prices and generation toa quantify combined effects of market fundamentals on market prices bcalculate price gap difference between actual prices and competitivemarket benchmarks c account for quantify effects of isos ancillaryservices requirements and forced outages and then d calculate the outputgap for high priced hours meaning the difference between observed andmaximum profitable levels of generation they conclude that prices were farin excess of the competitive benchmark and that the instate generatorscould have produced more power at competitive prices but chose not tohence market power was exercisedkahn the analysis group economist who presented is a very colorful andrather undisciplined advocate of his position he threw around allegationsof conspiracy rather casually but mostly to be funny i couldnt tellwhether he believed his study proved that i dont think it even speaks toit but bernstein and himmelstein applauded him when he finished grinningear to earseverin borenstein uc berkeley and the conference director was supposed tocomment on jk but hardly did he said that the generators would have beenstupid not to exercise market power given the supplydemand conditions andthe market rules and argued that permitting long term contracts andrequiring realtime residential pricing were the solutions to all of thisborenstein was the best expert material i saw at this conference and thefact he took a pass on the details of the jk paper is puzzling to me itmade me wonder whether he already has a horse in this race or perhaps istrying to stay above it allhope this is usefulregardsdandaniel m walllatham watkins

havingacquired sold divested joint ventured spun off and otherwise reorganizedthemselves extensively during the past two years the burden and expense onenron to locate and produce every corporate

ofdocument productions for portland general there will be a very large volume of documentsand we propose to handle them differently first portland general willprovide for year electronic data in summary form similar to the databeing provided by other enron entities to the extent relevant with respectto specific generating cost data because of the volume we suggest thatthese documents be made available in portland for inspection from arepresentative sampling of facilities if there are specific documents thatthe commission would like copied from that production we can discuss thearrangements for producing these documents we propose to make thesedocuments available in portland in a third wave of document productionstransaction documentsrequest we understand that the cpuc will be obtaining trading data for thepurchase and sale of energy delivered in california from the iso and pxepmi can provide the commission several different sets of trading data foryear in california and outside of california and real time for thepurchase and sale of energy delivered with the date counterparty quantitydelivery point hours price and whether it is purchase or sale becauseof the speed with which you want this information it is possible that someentries will be incomplete or inaccurate for those transactions where epmiserved only as the scheduling coordinator we understand that the iso willshow part of the transaction but there will not be a correspondingtransaction in the epmi data we can provide quickly the reason is thatthis type of transaction is passed through to epmis customer on anaccounting system rather than as part of the trading business eesi canalso provide similar electronic data with the proviso that it will notinclude the specific names of its retail customers but instead will providea blind customer number many of essis customers have agreements wherebythey must be notified of any subpoena and provided an opportunity to objectessi

iso__pricecaps ::::::>>>>>> false claims act here is the quick overview of the false claims act in california keep inmind that the california ag has offered a bounty or more forinformation leading to successful false claims act cases that show thatwholesale prices were too highthanksgary original message from smith amanda d sent tuesday april pm to fergus gary s subject false claims act gary this is a brief description of the relevant provisions of the california false claims act as we discussed a more indepth analysis will follow in memo form amanda the california false claims act cfca available at california government code section et seq provides that any person natural person corporation firm etc who commits various acts shall be liable to the state or political subdivision city county etc for treble damages sustained because of those acts that person may also be liable for a civil penalty of up to for each false claim and for the costs of any civil action brought to recover any penalties or damages initially the cfca defines claim as including any request or demand for money property or services made to any employee officer or agent of the state or of any political subdivision or to any contractor grantee or other recipient whether under contract or not if any portion of the money property or services requested or demanded issued from or was provided by the state or by any political subdivision thereof the cfca then describes those acts which subject a person to treble damages the covered acts potentially relevant to enron are knowingly presenting or causing to be presented to an officer or employee of the state or of any political subdivision thereof a false claim for payment or approval sec a knowingly making using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement to get a false claim paid or approved by the state or by any political subdivision sec a conspiring to defraud the state or any political subdivision by getting a false claim allowed or paid by the state or by any political subdivision sec a having possession custody or control of public property or money used or to be used by the state or by any political subdivision and knowingly delivering or causing to be delivered less property than the amount for which the person receives a certificate or receipt sec a knowingly making using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement to conceal avoid or decrease an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the state or to any political subdivision sec a being a beneficiary of an inadvertent submission of a false claim to the state or a political subdivision who subsequently discovers the falsity of the claim and fails to disclose the false claim to the state or the political subdivision within a reasonable time after discovery of the false claim sec a section of the cfca provides inter alia that a person a qui tam plaintiff may bring a civil action for a violation of this article for the person and either for the state of california in the name of the state if any state funds are involved or for a political subdivision in the name of the political subdivision if political subdivision funds are exclusively involved once filed the action may be dismissed only with the written consent of the court taking into account the best interests of the parties involved and the public purposes behind this act section goes on to describe the procedures whereby the state or a political subdivision may intervene in a suit filed by a qui tam plaintiff and how the damages recovered in such a suit shall be divided several other provisions of section could be extremely important when a qui tam plaintiff brings an action under this subdivision no other person qui tam plaintiff may bring a related action based on the facts underlying the pending action sec c a qui tam plaintiff may not bring an action that is based upon allegations or transactions that are the subject of a civil suit or an administrative civil money penalty proceeding in which the state or political subdivision is already a party sec d a qui tam plaintiff may only be an original source with direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based a qui tam plaintiff may not obtain information from the news media or from public disclosure of the information in governmental or regulatory hearings investigations reports etc and use it to bring suit under the cfca sec d if the qui tam plaintiff is a state employee that person must exhaust various internal procedures before filing suit under the cfca sec d if the state a political subdivision or the qui tam plaintiff proceeds with the action the court may award to the defendant its reasonable attorneys fees and expenses against the party that proceeded with the action if the defendant prevails in the action and the court finds that the claim was clearly frivolous clearly vexatious or brought solely for purposes of harassment sec g other relevant provisions of the cfca include the cfca defines knowing and knowingly to mean that a person with respect to information a has actual knowledge of the information b acts in deliberate ignorance of the truth or falsity of the information or c acts in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the information importantly proof of specific intent to defraud is not required sec b the cfca has various damages limitations provisions for defendants who cooperate with the states investigation the cfca has various whistleblower provisions protecting employees who disclose information about false claims in any action brought under section the state the political subdivision or the qui tam plaintiff shall be required to prove all essential elements of the cause of action including damages by a preponderance of the evidence sec cthis email message is for the sole use of the intended recipients and may contain confidential and privileged

iso__pricecaps ::::::>>>>>> revised draft proposal to cpuc privileged and confidentialattorney client privilegedraft draft draftharvey morris esqcalifornia public utilities commission public utilities commissionsan francisco california re i subpoenas served on enron powermarketing inc epmi enron energy services inc ees enron energymarketing corporation eemc enron energy services operations inc eesoand portland general electric corporation portland generalcollectivelysometimes referred to as the enron entitiesharvey here are our proposals with respect to the enron entitiesproduction of documents pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued bythe california public utility commission hereinafter the commissionthe enron entities are willing to assist the commission in undertaking itsinvestigation into the problems in the california electric markets byproducing a limited quantity of specified information on a timely basis webelieve that the limited production we propose will enable the commission tocommence its investigation much sooner than if the parties were forced tolitigate all of the potential objections to the requests for productionwhich are by any standard extremely broad and could involve millions ofpages of documents we make these proposals pursuant to our email exchangeof october with the understanding that the commission agrees that bycooperating offering to produce or producing documents the enron entitieshave not waived any objections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoeverand that any claims defenses objections jurisdictional or otherwise orother responses have been specifically reserved and can be raised in thefuture if necessary for all of these proposals we exclude documentsthat are protected from disclosure by the attorney client and attorney workproduct privileges subject to verification generally speaking the documents andinformation that the commission seeks can be found if they exist withinepmi ees and portland general to the extent that eemc or eeso arerelevant to the commissions investigation any documents would be locatedwithin ees thus we do not anticipate specific document productions fromeither eemc or eesogeneral documentsrequests through the enron entities have been very dynamic organizations havingacquired sold divested joint ventured spun off and otherwise reorganizedthemselves extensively during the past two years the burden and expense onenron to locate and produce every corporate organizational chart anywherein its organization since april is significant the enron entitieswill provide the commission with exemplars of its current organizationalcharts telephone directories and so called family trees to show itscurrent organization to the extent that enron can readily identify andlocate exemplars of significant organizational charts telephone directoriesor so called family trees for earlier periods it will also make thoseavailable one enron entity portland general has published books on itscorporate history if a list of those books would be helpful we canprovide it with respect to the other entities to the extent thatcorporate histories can be found they will be produced we anticipateproducing these documents in the first wave on october requests and the enron entities propose that their responses to requests willidentify their relationship to affiliated companies and the transactiondocuments will identify its customers and suppliersfinancial documentsrequests through the enron entities will produce their public filings for the periodrequested with respect to financial data epmi ees and portland generalwill provide to the commission electronic transaction documents for thepurchase and sale of energy delivered which includes economic data it isintended that this economic data will provide the commission with financialinformation regarding the enron entities which will be useful to itsinvestigation we anticipate producing public filings regarding financialdata on october and the electronic transaction documents in thesecond wave of document productionsgenerating documentsrequests and for the enron entities other than portland general the generationfacilities are limited in number and there will probably be limiteddocuments available the enron entities to the extent they act as ascheduling coordinator or possessed the right to use or resell generationoutput do not have the specific documents that pertain to each generationunit requested the enron entities other than portland general do havedocuments and information for enron wind saguaro and las vegascogeneration we propose to produce these documents in the second wave ofdocument productions for portland general the production of the requested documentswould involve a tremendous volume of documents as portland general ownedtwenty generating facilities of a variety of types and sizes during portland general is a net importer of energy and can only generate about onehalf of its total energy demand as a result we question whether theeffort required of portland general is warranted as its impact on thecalifornia wholesale market is necessarily limited in addition thosetransactions which do involve portland general sales into california arelimited to sales to the iso and px and long term contracts with two smallcalifornia municipal utilities thus the commission will receive theessential transactional information regarding these sales from the iso andpx nevertheless portland general proposes to provide for year electronic transaction documents in summary form similar to the data beingprovided by other enron entities to the extent relevant we propose thatthe commission defer requesting production of other information until it hasreviewed the information of generators who sell a significant proportion oftheir energy into the california market at that time a more accurateassessment can be made of whether this enormous effort will be valuablegiven the limited impact of portland general generation on the californiawholesale marketalternate ending to paragraph we propose for the voluminous portlandgeneral generating cost and maintenance data that these documents be madeavailable in portland for inspection from a representative sampling offacilities if there are specific documents that the commission would likecopied from that production we can discuss the arrangements for producingthese documents we propose to make these documents available in portlandin a third wave of document productionstransaction documentsrequests and we understand that the commission will be obtaining trading data forthe purchase and sale of energy delivered in california from the iso and pxepmi can provide the commission several different sets of transaction datafor year in california and outside of california and real time forthe purchase and sale of energy delivered with the date counterpartyquantity delivery point hours price and whether it is a purchase or asale because of the speed with which you want this information it ispossible that some entries will be incomplete or inaccurate for thosetransactions where epmi served only as the scheduling coordinator weunderstand that the iso will show part of the transaction but there willnot be a corresponding transaction in the epmi data we can provide quicklythe reason is that this type of transaction is passed through to epmiscustomer on an accounting system rather than as part of the tradingbusiness ees is a retail provider of electricity and plays a far morelimited role in the wholesale markets which are the subject of thecommission investigation however ees can also provide similar electronictransaction data with the proviso that it will not include the specificnames of its retail customers but instead will provide a blind customernumber this additional restriction is important to ees because many ofeess customers have agreements whereby they must be notified of anysubpoena and provided an opportunity to object ees cannot meet your timeframe to release information and give its customers the notice they requiregiven that ees was a retail provider and the fact that the identity ofretail customers is of little or no relevance to the functioning of thewholesale market we do not believe protecting the identity of retailcustomers is an unreasonable limitation or narrowing of the request weanticipate producing the transaction data in the second wave of documentproductionsferc documentsrequest the enron entities will produce the requests for data they receivedfrom ferc and to the extent that ferc has been given responses copies ofthose responses we anticipate producing the ferc documents on october based upon discussions that we have had with the various enronentities we believe that we could make a second wave of productions onfriday october it is possible that not all enron entities couldmake that date but we believe the bulk of the data could be available forproduction by then we propose to make these productions with the understanding that ifany entity obtains a more stringent protective order than the one currentlyin place that all of the enron entities document productions will beprotected by the most stringent protective order in addition if at therequest of any party or nonparty to this proceeding the commission or acourt of competent jurisdiction orders that the requests for production belimited reduced or eliminated the enron entities reserve the right tolimit the production of documents in conformance with such order we understand that you will consider these proposals and let us knowif they are acceptable to the commission if you have any questions orcomments

iso__pricecaps ::::::>>>>>> sf chronicle article power juggling ramped up price insiders say manipulation also strained equipmentchristian berthelsen scott winokur chronicle staff writers sunday may large power companies have driven up electricity prices in california by throttling their generators up and down to create artificial shortages according to dozens of interviews with regulators lawyers and energy industry workers those sources say the unusual maneuvers not only jacked up prices but also wore down equipment and contributed to the record levels of plant shutdowns that are depriving the state of muchneeded electricity the accounts are supported by an independent review of shutdown data by the chronicle the california energy commission calculates that an average of megawatts of generating capacity nearly a third of the states total was unavailable each day in april because of plant shutdowns more than four times as much as a year ago such shutdowns are the subject of increasing scrutiny as california enters another period of high demand the warm spring and summer months of may to september when electricity usage normally grows by a third loretta lynch president of the california public utilities commission said last week the agency has found considerable evidence of suspicious plant shutdowns and the california independent system operator which manages the states power grid says plant shutdowns have now become the primary means of constricting supply but an extensive investigation by the chronicle has found that not only were generators shut down to boost prices but these gaming tactics contributed to the plants deteriorating condition we suspected it said jim macintosh the manager of grid operations for the iso it was a sure factor in driving up prices such swings in unit output he said would only make sense in a scenario when theyre trying to game something otherwise why would they do that theyre tearing their units up unusual phone calls operators at a san bernardino county power plant owned by reliant energy inc say a complex plan to manipulate the california energy market began early last year with a series of unusual telephone calls from the companys headquarters in houston according to the accounts of three plant operators reliants operations schedulers on the energy trading floor ordered them to repeatedly decrease then increase output at the megawatt etiwanda plant this happened as many as four or five times an hour each time the units were ramped down and electricity production fell plant employees watched on a control room computer screen as spot market energy prices rose then came the phone call to ramp the units back up they would tell us what to do and we would do it said one of the men who only agreed to speak on condition they not be identified because they fear being fired afterward we would just sit there and watch the market change the workers said frequent and large swings in electricity output began at a number of california power plants just as the states power crisis began in earnest the workers and state power authorities assert the swings were one of the primary means of gaming the wholesale energy market it appears the control rooms are responsive to direction from the trading floors in houston rather than the reliability needs of the iso said carl wood a commissioner with the utilities commission who is overseeing that agencys investigation into plant outages instead of being responsive to demands for reliability theyre responsive to demands for profitability corporate denial reliant officials adamantly deny using this tactic or any other mechanism to game the california energy market they and other power companies including aes corp and a partnership between nrg energy inc and dynegy inc have asserted that skyrocketing electricity demand forced them to run aging decrepit power plants harder than ever to meet californias needs while acknowledging that the company issued changes in output levels as frequently as every minutes company officials said it was done at the instructions of the iso to maintain supplydemand balance as a part of routinely doing business within california and the california market design we are required to do that said kevin frankeny an operations official with reliant when the iso issues dispatch orders they dispatch on a minute basis it can go up and down many times within an hour frankeny said he was not aware of any instances in which reliant schedulers in houston ordered dispatch changes without the iso directing them to do it first the iso refused to comment on operations at any specific facility but stephanie mccorkle an iso spokeswoman said the ramping tactics were used beyond dispatch instructions during periods of tight supply and one of the plant operators said the orders to vary output came independently of the grid managers iso was not calling reliant every minutes for that said one of the operators not for an individual unit officials with the california attorney generals office declined to comment on the legality of the ramping practice citing a continuing investigation into whether wholesale energy prices are being manipulated one source familiar with the state of various inquiries said the ramping if proved to have been done to drive up prices could violate the states unfair business practices laws invisible practice how could companies such as reliant tinker with output and not get caught one of the plant workers said the practice was designed to be virtually invisible to regulators and grid operators when power companies bid on hourly contracts they agree to produce a certain amount of electricity over the given hour generators are paid based on an average of the spot market prices for that hour by driving up the spot price they can increase their hourly profits and still produce the total amount of energy required the plant worker said the units would be ramped down immediately after their output measurement which was performed at the top of each hour by the iso then he said it was brought back up as the spot market price of electricity rose in response to the reduced output by the time the iso measured again the output was back at the expected level another operator said the units were not always ramped up and down that if the price reached a satisfactory level generators would raise output and remain at that level as long as the price was right other times if the price was low output was brought down and kept down the same operator said the amount of ramping appeared to be a matter of individual will of the company schedulers in houston with some being more aggressive than others what they would do especially late at night is if the price tanked they would undergenerate an operator said then mysteriously the price would go up then if the schedule was at required megawatt hours of output theyd say go up to that would cause the price to tank and theyd say bring it down again rapid changes these fluctuations occurred within time spans of as little as to minutes the operators said but acceptable rates for bringing a unit from minimum to maximum levels when the plant was owned by southern california edison were more like minutes to avoid stressing the machinery one of the workers said moreover they were typically run at constant levels which also reduced wear and tear they were basically ramping up as fast as they can and then slamming the brakes on said one of the operators they were increasing the fatigue on the units iso officials say they changed market operations last fall to crack down on gaming tactics including instituting a socalled minute market rather than the hourly market so that it could be more easily detected when companies were withholding power but the iso says generator outages have now become the primary tactic in driving up energy prices a computer analysis by the chronicle of shutdown data over a recent day period shows reliant and three other generating companies topped the list of plant shutdowns reliant also represented the largest amount of wattage lost among those companies plants owned by reliant aes mirant corp and duke energy inc accounted for more than half of the states unplanned shutdowns even though their generating capacity was no more than percent of the states total capacity from all sources reliant one of californias largest and most profitable outofstate generators reported shutdowns during the period in march and april it was followed by mirant corp of atlanta aes corp of arlington va and duke energy north america of charlotte nc reliants unplanned shutdowns deprived the system of more than megawatts over the day period an average of per day enough power for million homes for one hour its ormond beach plant in oxnard with one generating unit down for days accounted for more than of those missed megawatts however an operator who worked in that plant said the outages there appeared to be the result of legitimate equipment failures reliant says there are valid reasons for its plants now to be in need of repair they are old at etiwanda is the oldest of reliants five california plants and the company says routine maintenance was deferred so the plants could remain in service during times of high summer demand but the operators said the issue is not so clearcut one problem at etiwanda a tube leak had been present for about a month and was previously reported to management they said but it had not deteriorated much it was operating at full capacity and there was no immediate need to take the unit offline because of the problem moreover at the time of the shutdown the iso had expressly asked reliant to keep the unit online the operators said richard wheatley a spokesman for reliant denied that any reliant unit was taken offline for unnecessary maintenance ramping may be rampant sources say reliant was not alone in using the ramping practice a source familiar with the state utilities commission investigation said output logs obtained from aes alamitos plant also reflected production fluctuations and an operator who has worked at the el segundo plant coowned by nrg and dynegy said the practice was used there although less frequently the scheduling calls came from dynegys trading floor in houston rather than nrg in minneapolis he said steve stengel a spokesman for dynegy said changes in output at el segundo were a normal function of changing demand levels throughout the day and denied the company was engaged in gaming the california market in a may report the california energy commission cited reliants etiwanda plant as well as the alamitos and el segundo plants as some of the major beneficiaries of high realtime prices that spring one way to obtain those high prices the plant workers said was the simple method of demanding a skyhigh price and refusing to deliver power if that price was not met on one occasion one operator said reliant ordered a unit at etiwanda to be shut off because the iso would not meet the price of per megawatt hour even though the legal price cap at the time was the operator said its our unit shut it off the source said email christian berthelsen at cberthelsensfchroniclecom and scott winokur at swinokursfchroniclecom

summaries of todays appearance by sen john burton to the sacramento press club and of his news conference this afternoon announcing a lawsuit against ferc john burton held what amounted mostly to a qa session at a lunch with the sacramento press club today he started by talking about the edison mou which he said will be assigned to the senate utility committee for review the judiciary committee will look at the legal elements and the natural resources committee will look at issues surrounding easements one columnist commented that burton would love it to death meaning it would get so much attention it will be hard for it to advance the mou he said includes language that eliminates oversight by the puc he said that will not be the case when it leaves the senate burton is obviously troubled by the mou he said some people say it doesnt just make edison creditworthy it makes them whole he said the following would have to take place for the mou to be acceptable back debt must be verifiedall creditors must take a haircutthe transmission lines would need to be purchased for an amount close to what the governor has mentioned million or more must come from edisons parent to pay back debt when asked whether million was enough he said no and that he feels the parent should pay a ton that led to a discussion of the dedicated rate component which he doesnt like he used the example that if electricity costs and the dedicated rate component is if prices drop to people will unnecessarily pay higher rates a larger infusion of cash from edisons parent could eliminate the need for the dedicated rate component burton called the dedicated rate component a big problem and said it could be the strongest argument for use in an initiative campaign he said he planned to tell the governor this afternoon that the state should set an acceptable purchase price for power and not pay anything more note this is a populist approach that is getting a lot of support from radio talk shows and other media he later threw out the number the state is going to have blackouts whether or not it pays top dollar he said so this is one way he sees to fight back its tough medicine but as he put it youve got to take castor oil and it tastes crappy but two days later youre over it and your stomachs ok burton also used a quote from his late brother phil on how he believe the situation should be handled the only way to deal with exploiters is to terrorize the bastards asked how long the committee process would take re the mou burton said the mou sets august as a deadline but that if there is ongoing progress there are allowances that would let the process go as long as into december lawsuit press conference shortly after the lunch burton held a press conference to announce a lawsuit against ferc was filed today in the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit a copy of the brief and press release was faxed earlier this afternoon to jim steffes and should be available in his office if additional copies are needed please contact me or scott govenar the plaintiffs are burton individually and on behalf of the senate bob hertzberg individually and on behalf of the assembly and the city of oakland at the event were burton hertzberg oakland mayor jerry brown atty joe cotchett of cotchett pitre simon in burlingame atty clark kelso a constitutional scholar from mcgeorge school of law sen liz figueroa and joan breuner vice mayor of oakland the suit asks for ferc to respond within days and a ruling within days burton opened by explaining that they were suing ferc for not fulfilling its statutory authority to maintain fair and justifiable rates hertzberg added that ferc had ignored the law and that they were compelled to file suit for californians relief joe cotchett said the suit is very basic and is based on the federal power act which he says limits power costs to fair and justifiable rates a primary strategy in this suit is to present it as a health and welfare and public safety suit he noted that there are million disabled children and convalescent homes in ca who can be adversely affected by blackouts he said it is not an economic lawsuit its about senior citizens disabled kids and convalescent facilities today also happened to be the legislative day for the california association of health facilities the nursing home trade assn and several nursing home workers were apparently asked to sit at the back of the room for effect cotchett said ferc has been told for years that there were opportunities to exert market power he also claimed that a redondo beach facility obviously aes was fined million by ferc for taking its plant offline and substituting higher rates he said however that this order had been sealed he cited an industry report that predicts hours of blackouts this summer which could mean four hours a day that could be he said potentially the ruination of a lot of medicine in refrigeration cotchett noted that only hospitals with more than beds are exempt from blackouts which does not protect surgical centers or many health facilities jerry brown added that prices are unjust and people are suffering continued high prices could mean potential civic disruption and that there will be more actions to mobilize western mayors liz figueroa spoke briefly to reiterate the health aspects of the lawsuit burton had mentioned clark kelso who regularly appears on tv here as a legal expert and i believe was a colleague of justice anthony kennedy in his press club appearance he said kelso had appeared regularly in the media early on to say that the state had no standing to file the suit burtons lawyers sent him the brief and kelso thought enough of it to join the legal team kelso reiterated that ferc has been aware of potential market power for three years and that the commission has delayed action unreasonably it has failed to define fair and justifiable that failure he said violates the equal protection and due process clauses of the constitution kelso said this is not a partisan issue and called upon fellow republicans to support the effort joan breuner sp oaklands vice mayor said only that she believed that if the energy situation were happening in texas rather than california the president and ferc would have acted long ago during the qa session cotchett said the urgency filing is necessary because generators supply of the electricity in ca and all five have rate renewals before ferc he also said one of the cases that is relevant is bush v gore in which the supreme court found that failure to set standards regarding elections obviously in that case violates the equal protection clause he also said six states have expressed interest in the case and have requested briefs oregon nevada arizona washington minnesota and one other he didnt name none of these states has yet committed to joining the suit

davis will announce a plan to relieve californias overloaded electricity grid this summer by paying businesses to run their highpolluting backup generators in advance of anticipated blackouts a top energy adviser to the governor said wednesday the backup generators will help us get through the summer said s david freeman who recently resigned as general manager of the los angeles department of water and power to lead davis drive for energy conservation freeman said he would leave it to davis to disclose details of the plan the governor will announce what hes going to do he said wednesday in a wideranging interview on energy issues with the bee roger salazar the governors deputy press secretary would not confirm whe n or whether davis would make such an announcement i dont know that the governor has signed off on anything like that salazar said under the plan participating businesses would turn on backup generators an d simultaneously disconnect from the electricity grid when power supplies are at stage nearly depleted the state would pay the companies for the muchneeded power that would be saved by converting to diesel generation deploying dieselpowered generators the dirtiest of internal combustion engines to forestall blackouts is another sign of the governors struggl e to get more megawatts flowing through california earlier this week davis lowered his estimate of the amount of new power tha t will come on line this summer from megawatts to megawatts a megawatt is enough power for to households the diesel plan also marks a significant turnabout in the davis administrations policy the governor and his appointees at the state air resources board uniformly have rejected such proposals from industries utilities and the operator of the states electricity grid arguing that routine use of the backup diesel s would endanger public health san diego gas electric has one such proposal scheduled for a vote today b y the davisappointed state public utilities commission environmentalists who have been catching word of the davis plan this week argue that it would shatter the governors repeated promises to stand firm on air quality standards during the energy crisis a letter signed wednesday by several of the states leading environmental organizations including the american lung association of california urged davis to reconsider given your awareness of the public health threats of diesel emissions please stop and have these proposals considered in a more thoughtful and public manner the letter states freeman argued however that the additional health threat from nonemergen cy use of diesel generators is marginal compared with the health and safety problems triggered by power outages this is a nobrainer freeman said youve got human lives at stake here this is a scary situation freeman cited for example people on lifesupport systems that could go aw ry in blackouts but sandra spelliscy attorney for the environmentalist planning and conservation league countered if the health impacts are so marginal why has the governors own air quality enforcement agency opposed this industries ranging from hospitals to food processing plants and data management centers have dieselpowered generators some the size of locomotives that kick on when a storm or earthquake knocks out power unlike dieselpowered trucks and buses most diesel standby generators run with little or no pollution controls because they are intended only for emergencies though the latest models run cleaner and more efficiently most generators in use today produce about times more emissions of smogforming nitrogen oxides per megawatthour as a new natural gasfired power plant according to air board engineers further the diesels spew high amounts of breathable soot particles that can cause cancer the engineers say davis plan would limit the use of the generators to days when the grid operator declares a stage alert meaning the power supplies are running l ow and rolling blackouts may be ordered to keep the states entire grid from collapsing according to freeman salazar the governors spokesman said only any backup generation involving diesel will have to be used as a last resort to prevent blackouts environmentalists who are trying to head off the plan said it would have th e state paying participating businesses at least cents per kilowatthour roughly three times the rate consumers typically pay for electricity freem an would not confirm the pay rate the davis administration has offered generators willing to sell new power exclusively to the state percent discounts on the air emission credits they would need to comply with smog rules for operators of existing power plants the governor has agreed to have taxpayers pay the entire cost of polluting above allowable limits in order to keep the lights on the latest plan to pay companies to run the dirty diesels during energy alerts further loosens the environmental reins the bees chris bowman can be reached at or cbowmansacbeec om bushdavis meeting set for energy crisis by david whitney bee washington bureau published may washington president bush will meet next week with gov gray davis to ta lk about californias worsening electricity crisis amid a shifting political dynamic on capitol hill that increasingly favors some controls on west coas t wholesale electricity prices details for the bushdavis meeting were still being worked out wednesday b ut the fact that the republican president is meeting with the democratic governor who is often mentioned as a possible challenger in was seen as a sign that the white house is facing increasing political heat on the energy issue california is a very big state said white house spokesman ari fleischer it represents onesixth of the united states its the sixthlargest econo my in the world and the president is very pleased to sit and talk with govern or davis its important davis spokesman steve maviglio said electricity price caps will be at th e top of the governors agenda for the meeting on tuesday or wednesday but fleischer did not commit the president to that kind of meeting in his first visit to the state since the campaign last year the president will spend monday night in los angeles and tuesday night in fresno until now the white house has steadfastly refused to meet with any elected democrat from california about the energy crisis despite repeated pleas fro m the democratic congressional delegation price controls have become the mantra of california democratic lawmakers an d a handful of republicans but the bush administration has flatly dismissed them as counterproductive to increasing power generation in the megawattshort state in recent weeks however there has been a developing shift in the attitude toward price controls on capitol hill bushs two nominees to the federal energy regulatory commission whose names were forwarded to the senate floo r wednesday for confirmation declined to rule out price controls once they a re seated on the panel and the apparent decision by vermont sen james jeffords to abandon the republican party would put democrats in control of the senate moving sen jeff bingaman of new mexico a pricecontrol advocate to the helm of the k ey senate energy and natural resources committee california sen dianne feinstein a committee democrat said wednesday that she has talked to bingaman and that he committed to moving her legislation to temporarily peg wholesale prices to the cost of production four republican house members from california have also endorsed some form of pricecontrol legislation on wednesday rep doug ose rsacramento announced that he is introducing a bill that while not technically a price cap would give greater price reli ef for west coast consumers than federal regulators or the bush administration have been willing to offer ose chairman of the house government reform committees energy subcommitte e said his bill would extend throughout the west a pricemitigation plan approved last month by the ferc but instead of that plan taking effect onl y during power emergencies as the commission directed it would operate aroun d the clock under oses bill to peg spot market prices at the cost of production of the leastefficient plant selling into the california market ose said his bill would encourage generators to sell their power through longterm contracts rather than on the volatile spot market i am looking for a middle ground ose said the bees david whitney can be reached at or

california edison pay off massive debts and avoid bankruptcy hit a dead end wednesday when republicans released a plan of their own the move could force democrats to sidestep republicans and vote along party lines on an alternative to gov gray davis proposed billion state purchase of power lines assembly republican leader dave cox of fair oaks said wednesdays split was necessary because there are few differences between the governors plan and the democrats plan the republican plan rejects the notion of purchasing transmission lines or hydroelectric facilities key components call for dedicating a portion of consumer rates to allow edison to pay off billion in debts in return ratepayers would receiv e either an equity stake in future power plants or the right to purchase electricity at discount rates few escape blame for crisis in poll by dan smith bee deputy capitol bureau chief published may utility companies and outofstate power generators continue to get the lowest marks for their performance in californias energy crisis but gov gray davis grades have slipped dramatically over the past five months according to a field poll released wednesday and californians it turns out blame plenty of people for the states powe r woes except themselves every player in the power drama gets poor marks except residential energy consumers which percent of poll respondents say are doing a good or ve ry good job to improve the energy situation only percent think they are doing a poor or very poor job public opinion of residential consumers efforts has improved since january when percent thought they were doing a poor job and only percent gave them high marks the public sees themselves as conserving energy said field poll director mark dicamillo thats the only positive movement in the survey for davis who faces reelection next year the movement is far from positive in the january poll the democratic governor received good marks from percent of those surveyed average grades from percent and poor ratings from only percent but when the field institute conducted its recent poll between may and sunday opinions about davis flipflopped after months of energy angst a handful of power blackouts and two rate increases only percent think davis is doing a good job while percent gave him failing grades the po ll also shows that californians believe the crisis will continue by an average of a year and a half well through the upcoming reelection battle all the rhetoric davis used with some positive effect early on is not goin g over well any more dicamillo said the public is starting to view this a s a longterm problem not some temporary policy shift still davis fares far better than his adversaries in the crisis preside nt bush vice president dick cheney and the energy industry the publics view of energy interests which was pretty dim in january dro ps even lower in the may poll utility companies received bad ratings from hal f the public in january but percent now believe they are doing a poor or very poor job outofstate energy generators whom davis has accused of gouging ratepayers fell from percent low ratings in january to perce nt in the may poll bush the federal energy regulatory commission and the state public utiliti es commission are not far behind drawing poor grades from more than half the public cheney the architect of bushs energy proposal received low ratin gs from percent the january field poll did not ask about bush and cheney because they had not yet taken office davis has repeatedly bashed ferc for not imposing wholesale price caps on electricity and has called cheney grossly misinformed on the states energy problems cheney in turn has called davis energy proposals harebrained and goofy the state legislature receives poor marks from percent of those polled while only percent believe it is doing a good job the bees dan smith can be reached at or smithsacbeecom new views emerging on power more elected officials support the concept of planned blackouts by john hill bee capitol bureau published may if californians are to be left in the dark they should at least know when to break out the candles or send the workers home thats the growing sentiment among a range of elected officials including gov gray davis who are pushing the idea of planning power blackouts and giving businesses and residents ample warning on tuesday the democratic governors office said davis supports longer public notice than the hours called for under a proposal by the californ ia independent system operator which runs the states power grid assemblyman mike briggs rfresno introduced a bill that would lay out a blackout schedule for the summer businesses could make plans for the possible blackout days and also be assured that on all other days the light s would stay on briggs called his plan an improvement on the existing system in which ever y day is a potential blackout day a senate committee meanwhile discussed planned blackouts as part of a strategy to gain leverage over electricity generators by declaring that the state will not pay above a certain amount for power the state would ask washington and oregon to join the socalled buyers cartel if the power generators refused to sell at the lower prices the state woul d gut it out with planned blackouts lets use the blackouts against the generators michael shames head of t he san diegobased utility consumers action network told the energy utiliti es and communications committee but shames and others stressed the need for warnings of at least hours and blackouts no longer than minutes absent that management of blackouts we dont see how the buyers cartel could work shames said on a visit to chicago on monday davis said he talked to officials about th e citys system for giving the public warning days before possible power blackouts with definite notice right before there is no reason to keep that secret from the public when their safety i s likely to be jeopardized davis told reporters tuesday the governor said he plans to meet in the next few days with managers at iso to explore the idea of a system like chicagos the grid operator announced monday that it will try to give the public at least a halfhour notice of outages but many officials said tuesday the public needs even more warning davis aides said the governors plan will g o beyond isos there are potential pitfalls criminals might make their own plans taking advantage of deactivated alarms and some say that a schedule of blackouts might increase the number of outages if people have been warned that a blackout is coming and a lastminute supply of electricity makes it unnecessary grid managers would have to decide whether to call it off said dorothy rothrock vice president of the california manufacturers technology association if they did it would add uncertainty to future warnings she said possibl y leading them to order unnecessary blackouts obviously there are tradeoffs rothrock said still the idea of planning blackouts seems to be gaining ground as a way f or the state to get back some control of the energy crisis sorely lacking in recent months it would help us as californians to say the hell with you george bush were going to handle this ourselves said jim overman of elk grove overman said he has been burning up the phone lines trying to persuade anyo ne who will listen that scheduled blackouts will make everyones lives easier briggs said he has been told by constituents including irrigators and food processors that scheduled blackouts are the way to go irrigators would know that they shouldnt plan on getting water on a day th at their electronic gates might be closed businesses could tell workers to stay home on a blackout day or arrange fo r backup power generators he said we would be very interested in it said ed yates senior vice president o f the california league of food processors power blackouts are chaotic for processing plants yates said requiring so me plants to be resterilized and shutting down operations for more than a day some processors might choose to close on days when they faced a blackout h e said losing revenue but avoiding the loss of thousands of pounds of food it doesnt solve the problem but it helps manage a very difficult situation he said briggs said that his plan would result in possible blackout days every two weeks the plan would assume that a certain number of customers would have to turned off to keep the grid operating if the electricity shortage went abo ve that amount people might still face unanticipated blackouts briggs said one question is public safety some are queasy about burglars knowing when blackouts will occur but pluses include the ability to arrange for tempora ry stop signs at road intersections or families being able to arrange for a sick relative to be moved if the police have only five minutes notice they cant get to difficult intersections to direct traffic they cant help paramedics fire departmen ts and ambulances get where they have to be davis said the manufacturers association and other business groups havent endorsed t he idea yet but say its worth a look its preferable to random rolling blackouts rothrock said the bees john hill can be reached at or jhillsacbeecom californians priorities for solving the crisis are outlined in a field pol l related graphic by dan smith bee deputy capitol bureau chief published may californians have some clear ideas on how to solve the energy crisis build more nuclear power plants cap the wholesale price of electricity and relax airquality standards to allow older plants to be upgraded and according to a field poll released tuesday theyre not so hot on the recently approved billion bond authorization to pay for electricity or the idea of gov gray davis seizing power plants through eminent domain poll architects said responses may be somewhat colored by respondents unfamiliarity with all the issues or skepticism on the causes of the state s power woes nearly percent said it essentially is an artificial crisis created by power companies to make money but on one longstanding issue nuclear power the poll showed a clear preference and a dramatic shift in public opinion in the highest recorded support for nuclear power in california since befor e the three mile island disaster in percent say they favor more nuclear plants in the state to provide electricity support among registered voters grows to percent with percent oppose d among democrats percent support more nuclear plants and threefourths of republicans and percent of others agree the change in attitude is very significant because they know this issue field poll director mark dicamillo said californians support for nuclear power reached nearly percent in the mids in the aftermath of a nationwide energy crisis but it plummeted to percent in after the partial meltdown at pennsylvanias three mile island plant and fell to percent in the last time field surveyed the question in voters demanded that the sacramento municipal utility districts rancho seco nuclear plant be shut down the utility complied and has spent more than million decommissioning it during the past years although the poll results are in line with some private surveys done recent ly by nuclearenergy advocates opponents say the field poll opinions could be misleading because the issue has been dormant for so long not since the la te s has an application for a nuclear plant been filed in the united states only two operate in california san onofre in san diego county and diablo canyon in san luis obispo when the poll questions are on issues that people havent thought about that much lately you do get some aberrant results said bill magavern a lobbyist for the sierra club people right now are obviously concerned abo ut electricity but they havent really thought about what it would be like to have a nuclear power plant in the neighborhood the field poll results lend support to at least one aspect in the national energy plan recently released by president bush who called for more nuclea r power plants nationwide but poll respondents were even more insistent that the federal energy regulatory commission should impose caps on wholesale energy prices despite opposition from the bush administration the poll showed percent of all adults and percent of registered voters including percent of bush s fellow republicans support the price controls it really does expose the bush administration to longterm serious problem s in california if theyre perceived as not willing to help the state in this regard dicamillo said the public really thinks price caps should be imposed republicans in the survey support price caps despite bush opposition and democrats narrowly oppose the move by democratic lawmakers and davis to authorize the largest bond sale in national history to pay for power purchases among all adults percent approve of the move and percent oppose it democrats disapprove of the bonds by a percent to percent margin californians desire for clean air is softening in the face of the energy crunch respondents said by a margin of percent to percent poll respondents say they would maintain airquality standards rather than relax them to build plants that

operation an increase from percent in january slight majorities support a staterun public power authority percent a nd stateowned power transmission lines percent but dicamillo said that some poll

house had given no hint until then that the president would address the issue during his upcoming trip to california however davis called the white house on tuesday night proposing a meeting with the president specifically to discuss energy he followed up with two letters on wednesday expressing the need for quicke r action on the energy front californians cant afford to wait four or five years for a permanent solution we need relief today in the longer of two letters davis wrote you and i dont agree on everything but heres something we do have in common we both inherited an energy mess and the people that elected us expect us to clean it up davis also offered in the letters to introduce bush to business owners a nd everyday citizens who have been personally affected by this energy crisis fleischer said wednesday that bush would meet with business leaders and energy consumers asked who initiated the meeting with davis fleischer suggested the presidents schedule had been drawn up independently of davis suggestions this is a case of they both want to meet with each other and were very pleased to be able to make it work out he said as for the meeting with the business leaders fleischer said the presiden t has several events on his schedule that already include business leaders an d energy consumers and so it very well may happen that were each suggesting similar things

percent at california facilities fleischer said that the president wanted to talk about how the federal government is going to be a strong partner to the state of california in th e cause of energy

republican fundraising events on mond ay and tuesday nights involving president bush and vice president cheney charging the republican administration with exacerbating the california situation by doing the bidding of the oil and gas industry in return for campaign contributions this is a contrived crisis in order to wreck our environmental protection laws waxman said it is a contrived crisis in order to produce percent increases in profits for some of these generators on the agenda when the committee meets thursday will be a bill by rep joe barton rtexas that would allow california gov gray davis to temporarily waive some air pollution limits to increase power production in the state when blackouts are imminent it also would include federal help to ease a power transmission bottleneck in the central valle y mandated power savings at federal facilities state discretion in adjusting daylight savings time an easing of the ties of some small independent power generators to larg e utilities earlier this month a subcommittee chaired by barton rejected waxmans pricecap amendment as some california republicans complained that the idea of limiting power rates was politically inspired and would do nothing to solve californias crisis the bush administration and the energy industry oppose price caps saying that such an approach would distort the market and worsen the electricity shortage in california and many other western states by discouraging exploration and production waxmans plan would require federal regulators in many cases to tie wholesa le power rates to production costs plus a reasonable profit at the press conference rep bob filner dsan diego derided republican opposition to price caps referring to wholesale power generators filner argued they were making money at a megawatt now they are charging up to believe me th ey can make money off the market with a costbase rate they have done it for years they can continue doing it rep jane harman

energy chief says anyone who requests a permit will get it by diane lindquist uniontribune staff writer may mexican energy secretary ernesto martens said yesterday that mexico wont s et any limit on the number of power plants in baja california supplying electricity north of the border since theres a window of opportunity here because of the need in californ ia for electricity anyone who requests a permit will get it martens said after speaking at the institute of the americas th annual latin american energy conference in la jolla power plant construction in baja california has become one of the most immediate solutions to californias electricity shortfalls at least three plants being built in baja california in the next four years will send electricity north of the border where blackouts have interrupted normal activity one facility a sempra energy corp power plant near mexicali will export all of its electrical output to consumers north of the border the san dieg o companys project gained quick approval from mexican authorities because th e facility is not subject to restrictions imposed on private companies that supply electricity to the mexican market other mexican energy officials have said several other enterprises are interested in building similar facilities in baja california such a mushrooming of projects is prompting concern on both sides of the border that the plants might have harmful effects on natural resources and public health and safety in his speech martens emphasized mexicos commitment to preserving the environment and local communities but afterward he said mexico will approve any number of baja california projects to serve california consumers i dont see any limit the only limit is the ability of the interconnectin g lines to transmit the electricity that is produced he said with a capacity of only megawatts each the two transmission interconnections linking the electricity grids of california and baja california will not be able to transmit all of the megawatts of electricity for the california market produced by the new baja california plants let alone any additional facilities sempra whose san diego gas electric subsidiary owns both the interconnecting lines plans to upgrade the interconnector near mexicali spokesman michael clark said yesterday the improvement will transmit electricity from sempras plant in baja california to the company substatio n in imperial valley the other connection links san diego and tijuana clark said he doesnt know how the other companies building baja california plants plan to transmit their electricity representatives of the firms cou ld not be reached yesterday even if the companies find a way to send electricity across the border the california grid system presents another obstacle to prepare for the possibility of more demands on the southern california grid the imperial irrigation district is analyzing what capacity it has fo r transmitting supplies on its lines and how to assess tariffs for the servic e its become very important because of our proximity to mexico said district spokesman ron hull the ability to transmit electricity is only one force limiting plant construction in baja california another is the supply of fuel to drive the facilities sempra again is a key player in this area it plans to build a north baja pipeline that will supply natural gas to its own and two other power plants in baja california and the proposed otay mesa plant in san diego the pipeline wont provide fuel for any other facilities its fully subscribed said clark in the future if there is enough demand the compression could be increased energy secretary martens however hinted at the possibility of new natural gas supplies in baja california he said mexico wants liquified natural gas facilities to be built in rosarito beach and ensenada while several companies have expressed an interest in such an operation martens comments were the first to

down the pike as the states energy problems worsen as the state throws its surplus down a rathole as our own utility bills skyrocket and as blackouts roll across th e state someone will write a statewide ballot initiative and get it on the ballot it will do two things first it will undo the deregulation of the states energy industry it wil l try to put everything back the way it was second it will punish the producers of power and energy it will levy some new fee or tax or it will regulate the industry as a publ ic utility or it will require that the state take over the industry entirely huge amounts of money will be spent against it opponents will outspend supporters by a substantial amount tv ads will run constantly predicting dire consequences if the initiative is approved well be told it will be bad for business labor leaders will tell us that it will cost jobs experts will say it will have no effect on the problem or make the problem worse all of that will probably be true the initiative will pass easily it will pass because it will appear to address what are widely understood a s the two main causes of the current energy crisis a badly bungled deregulation and unbelievably greedy energy producers it will pass because the initiatives authors will understand that most of us are furious about the way this mess was created and that were eager to tak e it out on

won t believe them its much harder to say whether the energy crisis will have more immediate political repercussions for some of the elected officials we might blame fo r the problem such as the state

elections for office are not yesno propositions you dont get to vo te up or down on davis they are a contest between two major party candidates which means election s are always a matter of

people will appear on the ballot in however the current political landscape is heavily populated with profiles in discouragement people who fearful of losing lack the nerve to run against a

be used it would only be as a last resort t o avoid blackouts said davis spokesman roger salazar ``unfortunately we are in an emergency situation everything is on the table californias persistent power shortage has led to rolling blackouts around the state several times this year with more anticipated when hot summer weather prompts people to use air conditioning if all of the states backup generators ran full time they would produce about tons of nitrogen dioxide per day thats more than nine times the pollution power plants produced on an average day in according to sta te air resources board data and the state would get only about megawatts of electricity barely percent of the states peak power needs from the backup generators that would be enough to power about homes ``they could have a huge negative effect on air quality said ellen garve y executive officer for the bay area air quality management agency ``its on e thing to run these generators during blackouts and emergency conditions bu t using them for other purposes could be devastating business groups that support the proposal include the league of food processors the california manufacturers and technology association and san diego gas electric ``these generators could go a long way to taking some demand off the electr ic grid and putting some supply back into the power system said gino dicaro spokesman for the manufacturers and technology association most of the states backup generators are small units that run on diesel fuel and lack pollution controls some are rentals and others can b e found at hospitals office buildings sewage treatment plants and universit y labs unlike backup generators intended for home use which are not regulated industrialsized units are limited in the number of hours they can operate but since the states power crunch began regional airquality regulators have issued emergency rules allowing them to run more frequently diesel engines produce carcinogenic soot and

picks its way through the lot of oildale energy a small natural gasfired power plant on the citys gritty northeast edge th e clamor of machinery and trucks sounds that meant prosperity here is gone employees have painted oildales machinery insulated the boilers and tweaked the motionless ton turbine now they wait ``its kind of like a skeleton says plant manager mike pankratz surveyi ng the octopustangle of pipes and tanks choked by the million pacific gas electric co owes it oildale shut down feb taking its megawatts of badly needed electricity with it t he hush here is the sound of small generators locked in one of the most seriou s issues of californias energy crisis one that state regulators plan to wrestle with today oildale is part of a growing legion of small generators from geothermal to gasfired cogeneration plants battling californias utilities and state price controls they say are crippling them these small generators owed about billion supply up to a third of californias electricity at least have sued southern california edison over unpaid bills four ha ve sued pge and pges bankruptcy proceedings in san francisco are clogged with motions from at least small generators including oildale in many cases these companies want to end their longterm supply contracts with th e utilities so they can sell their electricity on the more lucrative open market ``what this is basically is the revolt of the mice said bill short wit h ridgewood power management a new jersey firm that has shuttered three gasfired generators in california and sued pge officials to weigh debt the companies are hoping for action from the california public utilities commission which is scheduled today to weigh whether to order the utilitie s to pay the back debt meanwhile us bankruptcy judge dennis montali wades through motions filed by disgruntled generators and counter motions from pge the deteriorating finances of some of the approximately small generator s threatens californias fragile power supply just as the state heads into th e summer months up to megawatts short the deep and often unexpected economic impacts of californias energy crunc h add up daily in oildales case the shutdown not only jeopardizes the jobs of its anxious employees but those of more than employees at the refinery next door its one of the biggest public policy botches in the energy crisis some energy experts argue california is shooting itself in the foot by not attending to the relatively clean and efficient small power suppliers in it s own back yard they say gasfired cogeneration plants which provide powe r to nearby businesses and sell electricity to utilities are some of the mos t efficient producers in the state and many of the small generators harness renewable resources like the sun and garbage fumes lessening the states dependence on highpriced natural gas ``the idea that were refusing to step in and help them while were paying through the nose to pay dynegy and williams and everybody else this is jus t nuts said severin borenstein director of the university of california energy institute mentioning companies that own major power plants in the state ``this is really a major blunder the immediate crisis started in late january oildales pankratz explained thats when pge told the plant it was not going to pay for electricity delivered in december the news worried oildales gas supplier pankratz said which halted the plants supply pankratz turned off the plants turbine the move socked golden bear oil specialties the refinery that looms over oildale unable to operate without the cheap steam heat oildale supplies golden bear cannot heat the asphalt and industrial oils it produces golden bear filed for bankruptcy april last week it announced plans to lay off employees golden bear chairman carl soderlind said oildale golden bears exclusive source of steam heat for nearly years was a key reason his group bought the refinery four years ago having it go under was ``gutwrenching he said power unavailable the california independent system operator keeper of the states electrici ty grid reports that megawatts of power from small generators are off line it estimates that about half of that megawatts or energy for as many as homes is due to the financial squeeze of natural gas prices money owed by the utilities or both others say financial problems have megawatts off line lawmakers havent been much help the state assembly on march rejected a hastily crafted rescue bill meant to help buttress these companies the iss ue has languished in sacramento days later the utilities commission ordered californias utilities to pay the generators for electricity delivered in the future which saved many of them but it did not order the utilities to pay the hefty backdue amount s it also set a new rate for what utilities should pay the generators for electricity that price is percent lower and too low for business some argue the commissions position has been that the small generators should abide b y their existing contracts said commission attorney gary cohen ``to the extent that some of them are facing financial hardship the commission may take a look at whether it can do anything to help them visavis the back debt the lack of stronger action to support these generators baffles some critic s ``its like talking to a starving man on a desert island and saying `how long can you hold up until the ship comes said v john white director of the center for energy efficiency and renewable technologies some of the companies have appealed to the federal energy regulatory commission but regulators are waiting to see if the state and the courts c an resolve the issue ``were in what essentially amounts to an abusive relationship said shor t with ridgewood the independent generator that has sued pge two courts have allowed generators fighting edison to suspend their contracts five have lost their fights another five have won the right to put a lien on edisons assets in pges battle three of the four lawsuits are on hold because of the bankruptcy in the fourth a judge allowed a generator out of the contract it had terminated before the bankruptcy as for oildale it wants pge to pay the million it owes or oildale wants to sell its electricity on the open market it also wants pge to pay what it calls ``a fair market value for its electricity if oildale cant sell on the open market soon it will be forced into bankruptcy its attorneys argue pankratz estimates his plant can hang in limbo only three more months pge is fighting to keep its small generators which it says are exaggerati ng their damage it reports that only a tiny fraction of its generators ar e off line increased costs if the plants were released from their contracts pge could not afford to pay the extra million per month it estimates electricity would cost t he state department of water resources and ultimately ratepayers would have to foot that bill a fast solution isnt likely from the bankruptcy court the judge has made it clear the generators raise a host of complicated legal questions meanwhile the clock ticks ``weve all been a little tense says judy andreatta who has worked oildales front desk for years and worries about her job ``its just so scary watching everything happen whod ever think wed lose power electricity notebook ferc may renew price caps may from register wire services federal regulators this week announced that they might reimpose caps on the cost of transporting natural gas into southern california the federal energy regulatory commission on tuesday gave the public days to comment on the possibility of reinstating caps which were temporarily suspended by the commission this year the price controls were lifted in an effort to expand the reach of deregulation this proposed action said sen dianne feinstein dcalif could make a real difference since ferc engaged in this experimental lifting of the cap the price of natural gas in southern california has climbed to three times higher than t he rest of the nation said feinstein currently she said the price in southern california is per million british thermal units and only in the rest of the western region gas fuels most electricitygenerating plants in the state the commission also asked for comment on whether the caps should be limited to california or include other western markets legislators search for a plan b for edison davis tack is politically volatile the aim still is to steer clear of bankruptcy may by hanh kim quach and kate berry the orange county register sacramento lawmakers this week will seek to swap the deal gov gray davis made to rescue the states no utility from financial ruin with something more politically palatable davis deal some have complained is sweeter for southern california ediso n than for taxpayers so at least four proposals are being floated to supplan t that plan but legislators are far from a consensus on any of them plans emerge recede and are reconfigured daily energy experts and bankruptcy lawyers warn that too much legislative fiddli ng could result in what neither side wants bankruptcy for edison bankruptcy means the state would be stuck buying energy until both edison a nd pacific gas electric which is already in bankruptcy complete the chapter process which could take years experts and lawmakers said the states wallet would shrink affecting its ability to build schools and roads ratepayers might be on the hook for an additional billion for the companys legal fees because bankruptcy would freeze its assets said bria n bennett vice president of edison international the utilitys parent company southern california edison has said its willing to be flexible on the governors plan which calls for the state to buy edisons transmission gri d for billion company officials wouldnt comment on the various alternatives we understand that the transmission deal is the subject of controversy and are open to variations on it bennett said steve maviglio davis spokesman said the governor also remained committed to his deal edison is going to survive said mitch wilk a member of the state publi c utilities commission from through and a past president of the agency but the question is whether it will survive via the plan that th e governor negotiated or they do the same kind of thing pge did there is still a very real risk that sce will be forced into bankruptcy if the legislature tinkers too much with the deal or fails to move ahead promptly wilk said pge chose to file chapter last month because it was dissatisfied with t he progress of negotiations with davis on a state rescue of the company pge s move was an embarrassment for davis who had vowed to keep the states big utilities solvent one of the principal chips edison has with the state is not filing for bankruptcy said ed feo a lawyer involved with the pge case it would be a black eye for the state as long as the company stays out of bankruptcy they have something to trade edisons creditors are still waiting to see how the utility fares with the legislature some have agreed to defer receiving payments until the end of june dean vanech president of new jerseybased carson cogeneration said a lot of things need to happen before he and other creditors feel ready to drag edis on into bankruptcy in general we would have to feel like there was absolutely no hope in a deal being made vanech said but he admitted theres a concern that a resolution will not be put on the table in any reasonable period of timemeanwhile edison has vigorously lobbied the legislature to approve the transmission deal the company has launched a publicrelations campaign to persuade the public that it is in its interest said john bryson chief executive of edison international bankruptcy is a last resort bryson said in a recent interview we believe there will be a solution but changes are necessary said senate leader john burton dsan francisco because people didnt like plan a lawmakers cringed at some elements of the plan which many thought was over ly generous to edison limiting investigation of the utilitys parents compan y and guaranteeing the company an percent annual return on investment alternatives include requiring power generators to accept up to onethird less than the collective billion theyre owed taxing edison on its property and using the tax to pay off its debts and allowing edison to bui ld more power plants the latest proposal would require the state to sell bond s to pay off edisons debts and give the state the option to buy the transmission lines later most of the proposals would require an extra surcharge on ratepayers bills to pay off debts one hurdle the legislature faces rallying twothirds of each house behind one plan necessary any time the state spends money republicans have been philosophically opposed to acquiring transmission lines and half the alternatives include that element but stanford university professor james sweeney thinks compromise is possible lawmakers and the utility will strike a deal simply because a second bankruptcy would tarnish the image of the states political leaders sweeney believes however the outcome might be more fair in court bankruptcies are messy but so is the political process sweeney said were in a situation where the leadership politically seems not willing to bite the bullet it may be better for our state to have a bankruptcy judge who is very strong and who isnt planning for a higher office long beach obtains lien on edisons assets the city is the fourth small supplier with an attachment on the utility may by kate berry the orange county register the city of long beach became the fourth small power supplier to get a lien against the assets of southern california edison a move that could push th e utility closer to bankruptcy last week edison was ordered to freeze at least million in bank account s to cover payments owed to long beach for power edison bought from the city s trashtoenergy plant getting a lien on the utilitys assets ensures the city will be paid even if the utility files for bankruptcy stephen pickett edison internationals general counsel said the utility plans to appeal long beach also is suing edison international the utilitys parent company for breach of contract claiming the utility should not have transferred billion to its parent company over a fouryear period beginning in wh en deregulation was implemented edison international was required to honor the debts of its subsidiary said robert shannon long beachs city attorney so far edison has been sued by small power suppliers known as qualifyi ng facilities or qfs the lawsuits either seek to put a lien on the utilitys assets to recover unpaid debts or attempt to terminate year contracts to provide power to edison edison owes qfs about billion and is trying to combine the cases before a single judge in los angeles but long beach differs from other power suppliers because it wants to stay in its contract with edison we just want to be paid under our contract we still want to deliver them power said shannon as a municipality long beach also did not have to post a bond to obtain a lien as the other qfs must ed feo a lawyer for wind solar and biomass qfs said liens on edisons assets could have a domino effect two things will accelerate a bankruptcy filing by edison either the deal to sell its transmission lines to the state is going nowhere and alternative s are not acceptable or if attachments are made to the companys property that the utility doesnt want to run the risk of losing three other qfs have posted bonds to obtain liens against edison they include caithness energy which got a lien on edisons percent interest in two qualifying facilities that make up the mohave generating station in laughlin nev imc chemicals a unit of imc global inc of northbrook ill and that won a million lien and herber geothermal co and second imperi al geothermal co which is owned by covanta energy corp a former unit of ogden corp based

nuclear plants according to a poll released wednesday the last time the field institute polled californians about nuclear energy was five years after the accident at three mile island in pennsylvan ia and it found percent opposed to nuclear power in my interpretation the current energy crisis has some bearing on the publics changed attitudes on nuclear power said mark dicamillo spokesma n for the nonpartisan polling organization the public is searching for clean ways to add to the capacity the field poll comes as the bush administration pushes for a renewed look a t nuclear power no utilities have ordered any new nuclear power plants in th e united states since the poll of california adults was taken may the margin of erro r was plus or minus percent carl zichella the sierra clubs regional staff director said californians have not thought about nuclear energy for about years and do not have as much information as they did around three mile island i think this number really reflects a lack of knowledge on the part of the public about the problems that drove nuclear power underground he said the more people know about nuclear power the less theyre going to like it getting a new

calpine corporation nyse cpn and san franciscobased bechtel enterprises holdin gs inc today filed an application for certification afc with the california energy commission cec for its proposed russell city energy center in hayward calif the filing marks the beginning of an extensive cec licensi ng process required to build and operate an electricity generating facility in california the filing included a request for expedited review that would reduce the licensing review process period from months to months the proposed russell city energy center would be a megawatt natural gasfired combinedcycle electric generating facility located on approximately acres of land zoned heavy industrial at enterprise avenue in hayward the site is adjacent to the city of haywards wastewate r treatment plant which would supply recycled water to the energy center th e russell city energy center would provide needed electricity for hayward western alameda county and the san francisco peninsula the modern technology used at the facility would allow for a greater than percent reduction of certain emissions and is percent more fuelefficient compared to older gasfueled facilities in the bay area the russell city energy center will provide a vital new source of clean reliable electricity in the region said curt hildebrand vice president a nd general manager of the calpinebechtel joint development we look forward to working with the city of hayward alameda county and the california energy commission to develop a model energy center submittal of the afc represents the culmination of more than six months of extensive engineering technical and environmental studies we are hopeful that the considerable groundwork that we have laid thus far will make this project eligible for the six month cec review process hildebrand added we are seeking the expedited review to do everything we can to help solve the states energy crisis as quickly as possible once the cec determines that the application is complete and determine whether the project qualifies for the expedited review process the officia l review will begin as lead agency the cec will work with environmental an d government agencies in conducting its review and will hold local workshops and hearings to encourage community participation the expedited review process would require the same environmental and technical standards as the longer review period based upon the successful licensing of the project construction could begin in summer of with commercial operation by summer of copies

speed up the process of approving construction of new power plants as a way to fight the ongoing power shortage california is in a war with energy producers and the best longterm weapo n is to build more power plants davis said at a signing ceremony in elk grove california the bill will shorten the application process for a new or remodeled power plant as well as the time that local governments have to review proposals davis said the new bill will speed up two energy projects that are in the process right now including a megawatt plant in palm springs and a gas storage project in lodi that will store up to billion cubic feet of natu ral gas california has been suffering from a power crisis since last year which ha s caused repeated blackouts and sent the power rate spiraling the crisis is largely blamed on the deregulation law that forces the utilities to buy electricity from the wholesale market at higher rates than they charge the customers and the repairs of generators in some power plants an d the warming weather have made things worse after the heavily indebted utilities could no longer afford to buying power anymore the state government has used more than billion dollars of tax money so far this year to buy electricity on behalf of them among other measures to ease the power shortage the state government has called for residents to conserve electricity as much as they can especially durin g the peakhours during the dayresidents have been told to brace for a worse situation during the incoming summer from the oakland tribune lockyer probe may spark suit criminal charges could follow evidence of price gouging by steve geissinger sacramento bureau sacramento state attorney general bill lockyer said wednesday his investigation of alleged multibilliondollar price gouging by power generators has laid the foundation for a successful civil case that could w in huge refunds but the whole house hasnt been built lockyer said in an interview with ang newspapers the attorney general said the probe he expects to complete in the next eigh t weeks also may yet yield criminal charges which could result in power company officials being locked up with my tattooed dude lockyer a former east bay legislator rattled electricity suppliers earlie r this week when he told the wall street journal i would love to personally escort enron corp chairman kenneth lay to an x cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says hi my name is spike honey houstonbased enron like other energytrading firms has denied wrongdoing in the california market it dismissed lockyers comment as not warranting a response butquietlyprotested to the davis administration other power companies have expressed outrage i was trying to convey a message to the outofstate energy generators lockyer said i decided to make the point with the energy generators that theyve got a serious fight on their hands the attorney general however conceded he has felt guilty about it ever since because im a prosecutor and i take pride in being careful about thes e sorts of accusations or claims but i know it wont be in print unless i find some sort of colorful way to pump up the rhetoric he said we dont care if theyre multimillionaires we dont care if they run big corporations theyre buccaneers theyre ripping us off now while were still in the legal analysis of whether its legal or illegal greed its clearly immoral theres no debate about that lockyer said his investigators are scrutinizing tens of thousands of transactions and hundreds of thousands of documents to determine the streng th of the states case i think there is strong evidence that lays the foundation for a successful civil action but the whole house hasnt been built lockyer said a civil case could result in refunds that disgorge the obscene profits h e said the california independent system operator which manages the states electric transmission grid estimates that power suppliers may have overcharged california by billion since early last year the federal energy regulatory commission has so far tentatively ordered california suppliers to make only tens of millions of dollars in refunds as part of that agencys ongoing probe lockyer said criminal charges will be filed if investigators find that company officials intentionally engaged in unfair business practices the attorney general said he hopes to complete the work within the next eig ht weeks despite what he called stalling tactics such as those by three energy firms reliant and dynegy of houston and mirant of atlanta the three companies agreed tuesday to surrender copies of internal document s that had been subpoenaed two months ago by lockyer as part of the probe theyve been throwing anhour lawyers at us in high volume to drag their feet and stall our investigation lockyer said the attorney generals comments come amid a flurry of lawsuits and allegations by california officials against power suppliers as well as ongoing probes besides the attorney and ferc the legislature state public utilities commission caliso and the california electricity oversight board are all conducting investigations by medianews group inc and ang newspapers

commission in undertaking itsinvestigation into the problems in the california electric markets byproducing the information specified on a timely basis we believe that thelimited production we propose will enable the commission to commence itsinvestigation much sooner than if the parties were forced to litigate all ofthe potential objections to the requests for production which are by anystandard extremely broad and could involve millions of pages of documentswe make these proposals pursuant to our email exchange of october with the understanding that the commission agrees that by cooperatingoffering to produce or producing documents the enron entities have notwaived any objections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoever and thatany claims defenses objections jurisdictional or otherwise or otherresponses have been specifically reserved and can be raised in the futureif necessary for all of these proposals we exclude documents that areprotected from disclosure by the attorney client and attorney work productprivileges generally speaking the enron entities propose to produce documentsfor year as noted below we also understand that the commission willbe obtaining documents from the iso and px and we will not attempt here toduplicate documents that we understand will be produced by those entitiesas you will see in the general documents that are offered here forproduction enron energy services operations inc is the parent of enronenergy services inc and does not have operating authority or engage inwholesale or retail purchases or sales of energy thus the documentsoffered here with respect to those two entities originates with enron energyservices inc but we have designated them both as ees we also do notpropose to offer duplicative documents as between the enron entitiesgeneral documentsrequests through because of the dynamic nature of the enron entities businesses theburden and expense on them to locate and produce every corporateorganizational chart anywhere in their organizations since april issignificant the enron entities will provide the commission with exemplarsof their current organizational charts telephone directories and so calledfamily trees to show its current organization to the extent that theenron entities can readily identify and locate exemplars of significantorganizational charts telephone directories or so called family trees forearlier periods they will also make those available one enron entityportland general has published books on its corporate history if a listof those books would be helpful we can provide it with respect to theother enron entities to the extent that corporate histories can be foundthey will be produced we anticipate producing these documents in the firstwave on october requests and the enron entities propose that their responses to requests willidentify their relationship to affiliated companies and the transactiondocuments will identify its customers and suppliers we believe thisinformation will be sufficient to illustrate these relationships for thestaffs purposesfinancial documentsrequests through the enron entities will produce their public filings for the periodrequested with respect to financial data epmi ees and portland generalwill provide to the commission electronic transaction data thetransaction documents for the purchase and sale of energy delivered whichinformation includes economic data we anticipate producing public filingsregarding financial data on october and the electronic transactiondocuments in the second wave of document productionsgenerating documentsrequests and for the enron entities other than portland general the generationfacilities are either nonexistent or limited in number and there willprobably be limited documents available the enron entities to the extentthey act as a scheduling coordinator or possessed the right to use or resellgeneration output do not have the specific documents that pertain to eachgeneration unit requested the enron entities other than portland generaldo have documents and information for las vegas cogeneration we propose toproduce these documents in the second wave of document productions for portland general the production of the requested documentswould involve a tremendous volume of documents as portland general ownedtwenty generating facilities of a variety of types and sizes during portland general is a net importer of energy and can only generate about onehalf of its total energy demand as a result we question whether theeffort required of portland general is warranted as its impact on thecalifornia wholesale market is necessarily limited in addition thosetransactions which do involve portland general sales into california arelimited to sales to the iso and px and long term contracts with two smallcalifornia municipal utilities thus the commission will receive theessential transactional information regarding these sales from the iso andpx nevertheless portland general proposes to provide for year electronic transaction documents in summary form similar to the data beingprovided by other enron entities to the extent relevant as discussed belowwe propose that the commission defer requesting production of otherinformation until it has reviewed the information of generators who sell asignificant proportion of their energy into the california market at thattime a more accurate assessment can be made of whether this enormous effortwill be valuable given the limited impact of portland general generation onthe california wholesale markettransaction documentsrequests and we understand that the commission will be obtaining trading data forthe purchase and sale of energy delivered in california from the iso and pxepmi can provide the commission several different sets of relevanttransaction data for year in california and outside of california andreal time for the purchase and sale of energy delivered with the datecounterparty quantity delivery point hours price and whether it is apurchase or a sale because of the speed with which you want thisinformation it is possible that some entries will be incomplete orinaccurate for thosetransactions where epmi served only as the scheduling coordinator weunderstand that the iso will show part of the transaction but there willnot be a corresponding transaction in the epmi data we can provide quicklythe reason is that this type of transaction is passed through to epmiscustomer on an accounting system rather than as part of the tradingbusiness ees can also provide similar data with respect to relevantwholesale and retail transactions with the proviso that with respect toretail transactions it will not include the specific names of its retailcustomers but instead will provide a blind customer number due to eesconfidentiality obligations to those customers we anticipate producing thetransaction documents in the second wave of document productionsferc documentsrequest the enron entities will produce the requests for data they receivedfrom ferc and to the extent that ferc has been given responses copies ofthose responses we anticipate producing the ferc documents on october based upon discussions that we have had with the various enronentities we believe that we could make a second wave of productions onfriday october it is possible that not all enron entities couldmake that date but we believe the bulk of the data could be available forproduction by then we propose to make these productions with the understanding that ifany entity obtains a more stringent protective order than the one currentlyin place that all of the enron entities document productions will beprotected by the most stringent protective order in addition if at therequest of any party or nonparty to this proceeding the commission or acourt of competent jurisdiction orders that the requests for production belimited reduced or eliminated the enron entities reserve the right tolimit the production of documents in conformance with such order we understand that you will consider these proposals and let us knowif they are acceptable to the

iso__pricecaps ::::::>>>>>> fw enron proposals regarding document subpoenas here is your copy of the final version sent to the commissionthanksgary original message from fergus gary s sent friday october pm to hymcpuccagov cc mbd subject enron proposals regarding document subpoenas importance high harvey morris esq california public utilities commission public utilities commission san francisco california re i subpoenas served on enron power marketing inc epmi enron energy services operations inc and enron energy services inc collectively referred to as ees enron energy marketing corporation eemc and portland general electric corporation portland generalcollectively sometimes referred to as the enron entities harvey here are our proposals with respect to the enron entities production of documents pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued by the california public utility commission hereinafter the commission the enron entities are willing to assist the commission in undertaking its investigation into the problems in the california electric markets by producing the information specified on a timely basis we believe that the production we propose will enable the commission to commence its investigation much sooner than if the parties were forced to litigate all of the potential objections to the requests for production which are by any standard extremely broad and could involve millions of pages of documents we make these proposals pursuant to our email exchange of october with the understanding that the commission agrees that by cooperating offering to produce or producing documents the enron entities have not waived any objections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoever and that any claims defenses objections jurisdictional or otherwise or other responses have been specifically reserved and can be raised in the future if necessary for all of these proposals we exclude documents that are protected from disclosure by the attorney client and attorney work product privileges generally speaking the enron entities propose to produce documents for year as noted below we also understand that the commission will be obtaining documents from the iso and px and we will not attempt here to duplicate documents that we understand will be produced by those entities as you will see in the general documents that are offered here for production enron energy services operations inc is the parent of enron energy services inc and does not have operating authority or engage in wholesale or retail purchases or sales of energy thus the documents offered here with respect to those two entities originates with enron energy services inc but we have designated them both as ees we also do not propose to offer duplicative documents as between the enron entities general documents requests through because of the dynamic nature of the enron entities businesses the burden and expense on them to locate and produce every corporate organizational chart anywhere in their organizations since april is significant the enron entities will provide the commission with exemplars of their current organizational charts telephone directories and so called family trees to show its current organization to the extent that the enron entities can readily identify and locate exemplars of significant organizational charts telephone directories or so called family trees for earlier periods they will also make those available one enron entity portland general has published books on its corporate history if a list of those books would be helpful we can provide it with respect to the other enron entities to the extent that corporate histories can be found they will be produced we anticipate producing these documents in the first wave on october requests and the enron entities propose that their responses to requests will identify their relationship to affiliated companies and the transaction documents will identify its customers and suppliers we believe this information will be sufficient to illustrate these relationships for the staffs purposes financial documents requests through the enron entities will produce their public filings for the period requested with respect to financial data epmi ees and portland general will provide to the commission electronic transaction data the transaction documents for the purchase and sale of energy delivered which information includes economic data we anticipate producing public filings regarding financial data on october and the electronic transaction documents in the second wave of document productions generating documents requests and for the enron entities other than portland general the generation facilities are either nonexistent or limited in number and there will probably be limited documents available the enron entities to the extent they act as a scheduling coordinator or possessed the right to use or resell generation output do not have the specific documents that pertain to each generation unit requested the enron entities other than portland general do have documents and information for las vegas cogeneration we propose to produce these documents in the second wave of document productions for portland general the production of the requested documents would involve a tremendous volume of documents as portland general owned twenty generating facilities of a variety of types and sizes during portland general is a net importer of energy and can only generate about one half of its total energy demand as a result we question whether the effort required of portland general is warranted as its impact on the california wholesale market is necessarily limited nevertheless portland general proposes to provide for year electronic transaction documents in summary form similar to the data being provided by other enron entities to the extent relevant as discussed below we propose that the commission defer requesting production of other information until it has reviewed the information of generators who sell a significant proportion of their energy into the california market at that time a more accurate assessment can be made of whether this enormous effort will be valuable given the limited impact of portland general generation on the california wholesale market transaction documents requests and we understand that the commission will be obtaining trading data for the purchase and sale of energy delivered in california from the iso and px epmi can provide the commission several different sets of relevant transaction data for year in california and outside of california and real time for the purchase and sale of energy delivered with the date counterparty quantity delivery point hours price and whether it is a purchase or a sale because of the speed with which you want this information it is possible that some entries will be incomplete or inaccurate for those transactions where epmi served only as the scheduling coordinator we understand that the iso will show part of the transaction but there will not be a corresponding transaction in the epmi data we can provide quickly the reason is that this type of transaction is passed through to epmis customer on an accounting system rather than as part of the trading business ees can also provide similar data with respect to relevant wholesale and retail transactions with the proviso that with respect to retail transactions it will not include the specific names of its retail customers but instead will provide a blind customer number due to ees confidentiality obligations to those customers we anticipate producing the transaction documents in the second wave of document productions ferc documents request the enron entities will produce the requests for data they received from ferc and to the extent that ferc has been given responses copies of those responses we anticipate producing the ferc documents on october based upon discussions that we have had with the various enron entities we believe that we could make a second wave of productions on friday october it is possible that not all enron entities could make that date but we believe the bulk of the data could be available for production by then we propose to make these productions with the understanding that if any entity obtains a more stringent protective order than the one currently in place that all of the enron entities document productions will be protected by the most stringent protective order in addition if at the request of any party or nonparty to this proceeding the commission or a court of competent jurisdiction orders that the requests for production be limited reduced or eliminated the enron entities reserve the right to limit the production of documents in conformance with such order we understand that you will consider these proposals and let us know if they are acceptable to the commission if you have any questions or

proposal leading the charge for reregulation or protecti ng itself from economic disaster by will mcnamara director electric industry analysis ddddddddddddddddddddddddd ddddddddddddddddddddddddd ddddddddddddd pacific gas electric co pge in filings with the california public utilities commission cpuc and california independent system operator caliso has requested that a rate cap be placed on wholesale purchases in the state the utility is asking the cpuc to lower the current rate cap from per megawatt hour to or cents per kilowatt hour in seeking the rate cap pge is joined by edison international the parent company of southern california edison and the utility action network turn a ratepayer advocacy group analysis the current rate cap of per megawatt hour in the wholesale market of california resulted from the price spikes experienced in san diego this summer as san diego gas electric had paid off its stranded costs the retail rate freeze in its area was lifted and sdge customers were exposed to marketbased prices which doubled and at times tripled due to increased demand in the state and power supply concerns pge customers were not exposed to the price spikes because at the time pge had not paid off its own stranded costs and was still under a retail rate freeze yet the company has felt the impact from the price spikes just the same pge buys a great deal of its power on the wholesale market and as a resul t is about billion in debt some figures suggest it is as high as billion due to the retail rate freeze still in effect pge has been unable to pass this debt on to customers by raising its rates in real terms pge was paying up to cents per kilowatt hour on the wholesale market this summer when by law it was only allowed to charge its customers on average cents per kilowatt hour in total pge has paid about billion more to suppliers than it can bill customers for and this amount is growing by hundreds of millions each month this explains the utilitys motivation in wanting to see the cpuc further lower the cap on wholesale rates in california however even though pge as a whole is in debt the utilityas well as other divisions under parent company pge corpis still making money of f deregulation in california for instance pges diablo canyon nuclear plant has been able to capitalize on the high value of power on the wholesa le market the utility confirmed recently that altogether its power facilities the ones left after the utility was forced to divest the bulk of its power assetsstill provide about million a month to the utility in addit ion pge corps unregulated energy commodity trading operation has been doing very well and the unregulated national energy groupwhich operates in markets outside of california such as massachusetts rhode island and new hampshireposted a percent profit increase for the second quarte r thus it is important to note the distinction between pge and its parent pge corp ironically as a whole pge corp has stated that it does not support rate caps and has opposed the issue when it has surfaced in other states pge reported secondquarter earnings of million on billion in revenue representing a percent increase over the same quarter last year third quarter earnings also reportedly will be strong this puts pge in an awkward predicament on one hand pge wants to convince shareholders that the company is doing well and making money from the commodities that it sells on the other hand pge is attempting to convince regulators that it is losing money due to the high wholesale prices that it must pay for power in fairness though the revenue pge has earned cannot come anywhere near to paying off the massive debt the company has accrued due to its obligation of serving customers pges rate freeze is scheduled to end march at the very latest or sooner if it is determined that pges stranded costs have been repaid something that utility executives say may already have taken place due to higherthanexpected revenues and higherthanmarket valuations of the utilitys assets it may very well be the case that pges stranded costs are already paid off when this is officially determined by the cpuc pge will argue that customers should be liable for some or all of the debt it has assumed while the rate caps were in place the cpuc has scheduled a hearing to address these issues on oct the core question of these proceedings will be whether or not pge should be allowed to turn over its debt to customers through rate increases once the rate freeze is lifted pge wants to be able to retroactively bill customers for its debt based on the date which the cpuc determines that pge had in fact paid off its stranded costs a point groups such as turn will surely protest it may seem surprising that turn was among the group with pge that filed the petition to lower the rate cap on wholesale prices typically turn and pge along with most utilities are at polar opposites regarding most issues however both agree that wholesale rates are too high and want to see a new cap put into place but for completely different reasons turn says that pge and other utilities took a risk when agreeing to the rate freeze and they should not be allowed to pass debts that resulted from that risk onto customers turn continues to retain a watch over the proceedings related to pges proposal specifically with regard to the possibility that the cpuc will allow the utility to raise rates on customer s within the course of these new developments its important to be clear on pges motivations some california lawmakers and consumer advocates have called for a complete return to regulation arguing that deregulation in california has become a failed experiment many have surmised that pge s proposal for wholesale caps is essentially a call to return california to a regulated structure i think this is a misinterpretation pge has very clearly stated that its proposal is a necessary shortterm step to try to bring prices back in line pges efforts really shouldnt be viewe d as a move to return california to a regulated market rather pge is merel y attempting to protect its own interests the utility wants to secure temporary lower rates for the power it needs to buy on the wholesale market and transfer its debts to customers once the rate freeze is lifted a return to regulati on via a permanent rate cap would not be in pges best interests as it continues to sell power from its nuclear plant in addition pge probably recognizes that regulation would discourage additional companies from building new power plants in california which would not be good for the longterm econo my of the state this also would do little to lower wholesale prices in california as we discovered this summer the less supply the higher the price for power pges proposal to lower rate caps on wholesale prices is more than anythi ng else an attempt to protect itself from what it perceives as disastrous economic impact if it is not able to transfer its debt to customers a recent wall street journal report inferred that if wholesale prices continu e to exceed what pge can charge customers the utility could become technically insolvent sometime next year it will be interesting to see if the cpuc has the same perception when it evaluates pges proposal later this

iso__pricecaps ::::::>>>>>> sf chronicle article power juggling ramped up price insiders say manipulation also strained equipmentchristian berthelsen scott winokur chronicle staff writers sunday may large power companies have driven up electricity prices in california by throttling their generators up and down to create artificial shortages according to dozens of interviews with regulators lawyers and energy industry workers those sources say the unusual maneuvers not only jacked up prices but also wore down equipment and contributed to the record levels of plant shutdowns that are depriving the state of muchneeded electricity the accounts are supported by an independent review of shutdown data by the chronicle the california energy commission calculates that an average of megawatts of generating capacity nearly a third of the states total was unavailable each day in april because of plant shutdowns more than four times as much as a year ago such shutdowns are the subject of increasing scrutiny as california enters another period of high demand the warm spring and summer months of may to september when electricity usage normally grows by a third loretta lynch president of the california public utilities commission said last week the agency has found considerable evidence of suspicious plant shutdowns and the california independent system operator which manages the states power grid says plant shutdowns have now become the primary means of constricting supply but an extensive investigation by the chronicle has found that not only were generators shut down to boost prices but these gaming tactics contributed to the plants deteriorating condition we suspected it said jim macintosh the manager of grid operations for the iso it was a sure factor in driving up prices such swings in unit output he said would only make sense in a scenario when theyre trying to game something otherwise why would they do that theyre tearing their units up unusual phone calls operators at a san bernardino county power plant owned by reliant energy inc say a complex plan to manipulate the california energy market began early last year with a series of unusual telephone calls from the companys headquarters in houston according to the accounts of three plant operators reliants operations schedulers on the energy trading floor ordered them to repeatedly decrease then increase output at the megawatt etiwanda plant this happened as many as four or five times an hour each time the units were ramped down and electricity production fell plant employees watched on a control room computer screen as spot market energy prices rose then came the phone call to ramp the units back up they would tell us what to do and we would do it said one of the men who only agreed to speak on condition they not be identified because they fear being fired afterward we would just sit there and watch the market change the workers said frequent and large swings in electricity output began at a number of california power plants just as the states power crisis began in earnest the workers and state power authorities assert the swings were one of the primary means of gaming the wholesale energy market it appears the control rooms are responsive to direction from the trading floors in houston rather than the reliability needs of the iso said carl wood a commissioner with the utilities commission who is overseeing that agencys investigation into plant outages instead of being responsive to demands for reliability theyre responsive to demands for profitability corporate denial reliant officials adamantly deny using this tactic or any other mechanism to game the california energy market they and other power companies including aes corp and a partnership between nrg energy inc and dynegy inc have asserted that skyrocketing electricity demand forced them to run aging decrepit power plants harder than ever to meet californias needs while acknowledging that the company issued changes in output levels as frequently as every minutes company officials said it was done at the instructions of the iso to maintain supplydemand balance as a part of routinely doing business within california and the california market design we are required to do that said kevin frankeny an operations official with reliant when the iso issues dispatch orders they dispatch on a minute basis it can go up and down many times within an hour frankeny said he was not aware of any instances in which reliant schedulers in houston ordered dispatch changes without the iso directing them to do it first the iso refused to comment on operations at any specific facility but stephanie mccorkle an iso spokeswoman said the ramping tactics were used beyond dispatch instructions during periods of tight supply and one of the plant operators said the orders to vary output came independently of the grid managers iso was not calling reliant every minutes for that said one of the operators not for an individual unit officials with the california attorney generals office declined to comment on the legality of the ramping practice citing a continuing investigation into whether wholesale energy prices are being manipulated one source familiar with the state of various inquiries said the ramping if proved to have been done to drive up prices could violate the states unfair business practices laws invisible practice how could companies such as reliant tinker with output and not get caught one of the plant workers said the practice was designed to be virtually invisible to regulators and grid operators when power companies bid on hourly contracts they agree to produce a certain amount of electricity over the given hour generators are paid based on an average of the spot market prices for that hour by driving up the spot price they can increase their hourly profits and still produce the total amount of energy required the plant worker said the units would be ramped down immediately after their output measurement which was performed at the top of each hour by the iso then he said it was brought back up as the spot market price of electricity rose in response to the reduced output by the time the iso measured again the output was back at the expected level another operator said the units were not always ramped up and down that if the price reached a satisfactory level generators would raise output and remain at that level as long as the price was right other times if the price was low output was brought down and kept down the same operator said the amount of ramping appeared to be a matter of individual will of the company schedulers in houston with some being more aggressive than others what they would do especially late at night is if the price tanked they would undergenerate an operator said then mysteriously the price would go up then if the schedule was at required megawatt hours of output theyd say go up to that would cause the price to tank and theyd say bring it down again rapid changes these fluctuations occurred within time spans of as little as to minutes the operators said but acceptable rates for bringing a unit from minimum to maximum levels when the plant was owned by southern california edison were more like minutes to avoid stressing the machinery one of the workers said moreover they were typically run at constant levels which also reduced wear and tear they were basically ramping up as fast as they can and then slamming the brakes on said one of the operators they were increasing the fatigue on the units iso officials say they changed market operations last fall to crack down on gaming tactics including instituting a socalled minute market rather than the hourly market so that it could be more easily detected when companies were withholding power but the iso says generator outages have now become the primary tactic in driving up energy prices a computer analysis by the chronicle of shutdown data over a recent day period shows reliant and three other generating companies topped the list of plant shutdowns reliant also represented the largest amount of wattage lost among those companies plants owned by reliant aes mirant corp and duke energy inc accounted for more than half of the states unplanned shutdowns even though their generating capacity was no more than percent of the states total capacity from all sources reliant one of californias largest and most profitable outofstate generators reported shutdowns during the period in march and april it was followed by mirant corp of atlanta aes corp of arlington va and duke energy north america of charlotte nc reliants unplanned shutdowns deprived the system of more than megawatts over the day period an average of per day enough power for million homes for one hour its ormond beach plant in oxnard with one generating unit down for days accounted for more than of those missed megawatts however an operator who worked in that plant said the outages there appeared to be the result of legitimate equipment failures reliant says there are valid reasons for its plants now to be in need of repair they are old at etiwanda is the oldest of reliants five california plants and the company says routine maintenance was deferred so the plants could remain in service during times of high summer demand but the operators said the issue is not so clearcut one problem at etiwanda a tube leak had been present for about a month and was previously reported to management they said but it had not deteriorated much it was operating at full capacity and there was no immediate need to take the unit offline because of the problem moreover at the time of the shutdown the iso had expressly asked reliant to keep the unit online the operators said richard wheatley a spokesman for reliant denied that any reliant unit was taken offline for unnecessary maintenance ramping may be rampant sources say reliant was not alone in using the ramping practice a source familiar with the state utilities commission investigation said output logs obtained from aes alamitos plant also reflected production fluctuations and an operator who has worked at the el segundo plant coowned by nrg and dynegy said the practice was used there although less frequently the scheduling calls came from dynegys trading floor in houston rather than nrg in minneapolis he said steve stengel a spokesman for dynegy said changes in output at el segundo were a normal function of changing demand levels throughout the day and denied the company was engaged in gaming the california market in a may report the california energy commission cited reliants etiwanda plant as well as the alamitos and el segundo plants as some of the major beneficiaries of high realtime prices that spring one way to obtain those high prices the plant workers said was the simple method of demanding a skyhigh price and refusing to deliver power if that price was not met on one occasion one operator said reliant ordered a unit at etiwanda to be shut off because the iso would not meet the price of per megawatt hour even though the legal price cap at the time was the operator said its our unit shut it off the source said email christian berthelsen at cberthelsensfchroniclecom and scott winokur at swinokursfchroniclecom

following are summaries of todays appearance by sen john burton to th e sacramento press club and of his news conference this afternoon announcin g a lawsuit against ferc john burton held what amounted mostly to a qa session at a lunch with the sacramento press club today he started by talking about the edison mou wh ich he said will be assigned to the senate utility committee for review th e judiciary committee will look at the legal elements and the natural reso urces committee will look at issues surrounding easements one columnist commented that burton would love it to death meaning it would get so muc h attention it will be hard for it to advance the mou he said includes language that eliminates oversight by the puc he said that will not be the case when it leaves the senate burton is obviously troubled by the mou he said some people say it doesn t just make edison creditworthy it makes them whole he said the followi ng would have to take place for the mou to be acceptable back debt must be verified all creditors must take a haircut the transmission lines would need to be purchased for an amount close to wh at the governor has mentioned million or more must come from edisons parent to pay back debt when asked whether million was enough he said no and that he feels the parent should pay a ton that led to a discussion of the dedicated r ate component which he doesnt like he used the example that if electrici ty costs and the dedicated rate component is if prices drop to people will unnecessarily pay higher rates a larger infusion of cash from edisons parent could eliminate the need for the dedicated rate component burton called the dedicated rate component a big problem and said it coul d be the strongest argument for use in an initiative campaign he said he planned to tell the governor this afternoon that the state shoul d set an acceptable purchase price for power and not pay anything more not e this is a populist approach that is getting a lot of support from radio talk shows and other media he later threw out the number the sta te is going to have blackouts whether or not it pays top dollar he said s o this is one way he sees to fight back its tough medicine but as he pu t it youve got to take castor oil and it tastes crappy but two days lat er youre over it and your stomachs ok burton also used a quote from his late brother phil on how he believe the situation should be handled the only way to deal with exploiters is to terrorize the bastards asked how long the committee process would take re the mou burton said th e mou sets august as a deadline but that if there is ongoing progress th ere are allowances that would let the process go as long as into december lawsuit press conference shortly after the lunch burton held a press conference to announce a lawsu it against ferc was filed today in the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit a copy of the brief and press release was faxed earlier this afte rnoon to jim steffes and should be available in his office if additional copies are needed please contact me or scott govenar the plaintiffs are burton individually and on behalf of the senate bob he rtzberg individually and on behalf of the assembly and the city of oaklan d at the event were burton hertzberg oakland mayor jerry brown atty j oe cotchett of cotchett pitre simon in burlingame atty clark kelso a constitutional scholar from mcgeorge school of law sen liz figueroa an d joan breuner vice mayor of oakland the suit asks for ferc to respond within days and a ruling within days burton opened by explaining that they were suing ferc for not fulfilling it s statutory authority to maintain fair and justifiable rates hertzberg ad ded that ferc had ignored the law and that they were compelled to file suit for californians relief joe cotchett said the suit is very basic and is based on the federal powe r act which he says limits power costs to fair and justifiable rates a primary strategy in this suit is to present it as a health and welfare a nd public safety suit he noted that there are million disabled children and convalescent homes in ca who can be adversely affected by blacko uts he said it is not an economic lawsuit its about senior citizens disabled kids and convalescent facilities today also happened to be the legislative day for the california association of health facilities the n ursing home trade assn and several nursing home workers were apparently asked to sit at the back of the room for effect cotchett said ferc has been told for years that there were opportunities to exert market power he also claimed that a redondo beach facility obvi ously aes was fined million by ferc for taking its plant offline and s ubstituting higher rates he said however that this order had been seale d he cited an industry report that predicts hours of blackouts this summe r which could mean four hours a day that could be he said potentially the ruination of a lot of medicine in refrigeration cotchett noted that only hospitals with more than beds are exempt from blackouts which do es not protect surgical centers or many health facilities jerry brown added that prices are unjust and people are suffering conti nued high prices could mean potential civic disruption and that there wi ll be more actions to mobilize western mayors liz figueroa spoke briefly to reiterate the health aspects of the lawsuit burton had mentioned clark kelso who regularly appears on tv here as a leg al expert and i believe was a colleague of justice anthony kennedy in his press club appearance he said kelso had appeared regularly in the media e arly on to say that the state had no standing to file the suit burtons la wyers sent him the brief and kelso thought enough of it to join the legal team kelso reiterated that ferc has been aware of potential market power for thr ee years and that the commission has delayed action unreasonably it has failed to define fair and justifiable that failure he said violates th e equal protection and due process clauses of the constitution kelso said this is not a partisan issue and called upon fellow republican s to support the effort joan breuner sp oaklands vice mayor said only that she believed that if the energy situation were happening in texas rather than california the president and ferc would have acted long ago during the qa session cotchett said the urgency filing is necessary becau se generators supply of the electricity in ca and all five have rat e renewals before ferc he also said one of the cases that

relieve californias overloaded electricity grid this summer by paying businesses to run their highpolluting backup generators in advance of anticipated blackouts a top energy adviser to the governor s aid wednesday the backup generators will help us get through the summer said s david freeman who recently resigned as general manager of the lo s angeles department of water and power to lead davis drive for energy con servation freeman said he would leave it to davis to disclose details of the plan the governor will announce what hes going to do he said wedn esday in a wideranging interview on energy issues with the bee roger sal azar the governors deputy press secretary would not confirm when or whet her davis would make such an announcement i dont know that the governor has signed off on anything like that salazar said under the plan part icipating businesses would turn on backup generators and simultaneously dis connect from the electricity grid when power supplies are at stage nea rly depleted the state would pay the companies for the muchneeded power that would be saved by converting to diesel generation deploying dieselp owered generators the dirtiest of internal combustion engines to fore stall blackouts is another sign of the governors struggle to get more mega watts flowing through california earlier this week davis lowered his esti mate of the amount of new power that will come on line this summer from megawatts to megawatts a megawatt is enough power for to households the diesel plan also marks a significant turnabout in the da vis administrations policy the governor and his appointees at the state air resources board uniformly have rejected such proposals from industries utilities and the operator of the states electricity grid arguing that r outine use of the backup diesels would endanger public health san diego g as electric has one such proposal scheduled for a vote today by the davis appointed state public utilities commission environmentalists who have b een catching word of the davis plan this week argue that it would shatter t he governors repeated promises to stand firm on air quality standards duri ng the energy crisis a letter signed wednesday by several of the states leading environmental organizations including the american lung associatio n of california urged davis to reconsider given your awareness of the p ublic health threats of diesel emissions please stop and have these propos als considered in a more thoughtful and public manner the letter states freeman argued however that the additional health threat from nonemerge ncy use of diesel generators is marginal compared with the health and saf ety problems triggered by power outages this is a nobrainer freeman s aid youve got human lives at stake here this is a scary situation fr eeman cited for example people on lifesupport systems that could go awry in blackouts but sandra spelliscy attorney for the environmentalist pla nning and conservation league countered if the health impacts are so mar ginal why has the governors own air quality enforcement agency opposed th is industries ranging from hospitals to food processing plants and data management centers have dieselpowered generators some the size of locom otives that kick on when a storm or earthquake knocks out power unlike dieselpowered trucks and buses most diesel standby generators run with l ittle or no pollution controls because they are intended only for emergenci es though the latest models run cleaner and more efficiently most genera tors in use today produce about times more emissions of smogforming ni trogen oxides per megawatthour as a new natural gasfired power plant acc ording to air board engineers further the diesels spew high amounts of br eathable soot particles that can cause cancer the engineers say davis p lan would limit the use of the generators to days when the grid operator de clares a stage alert meaning the power supplies are running low and roll ing blackouts may be ordered to keep the states entire grid from collapsin g according to freeman salazar the governors spokesman said only an y backup generation involving diesel will have to be used as a last resort to prevent blackouts environmentalists who are trying to head off the pl an said it would have the state paying participating businesses at least cents per kilowatthour roughly three times the rate consumers typically pay for electricity freeman would not confirm the pay rate the davis adm inistration has offered generators willing to sell new power exclusively to the state percent discounts on the air emission credits they would need to comply with smog rules for operators of existing power plants the go vernor has agreed to have taxpayers pay the entire cost of polluting above allowable limits in order to keep the lights on the latest plan to pay co mpanies to run the dirty diesels during energy alerts further loosens the e nvironmental reins the bees chris

united states its the sixthlargest economy in the world and the president is very pleased to sit and talk wit h governor davis its important davis spokesman steve maviglio said electricity price caps

from only percent but when the field institute conducted its recen t poll between may and sunday opinions about davis flipflopped after months of energy angst a handful of power blackouts and two rate increases only percent think davis is doing a good job while percent gave hi m failing grades the poll also shows that californians believe the crisis will continue by an average of a year and a half well through the upcoming reelection battle all the rhetoric davis used with some positive effec t early on is not going over well any more dicamillo said the public is starting to view this as a

blackouts by john hill bee capitol bureau published may if californians are to be left in the dark they should at least k now when to break out the candles or send the workers home thats the gro wing sentiment among a range of elected officials including gov gray davi s who are pushing the idea of planning power blackouts and giving business es and residents ample warning on tuesday the democratic governors offi ce said davis supports longer public notice than the hours called for un der a proposal by the california independent system operator which runs th e states power grid assemblyman mike briggs rfresno introduced a bill that would lay out a blackout schedule for the summer businesses could ma ke plans for the possible blackout days and also be assured that on all oth er days the lights would stay on briggs called his plan an improvement on the existing system in which every day is a potential blackout day a s enate committee meanwhile discussed planned blackouts as part of a strate gy to gain leverage over electricity generators by declaring that the state will not pay above a certain amount for power the state would ask washing ton and oregon to join the socalled buyers cartel if the power genera tors refused to sell at the lower prices the state would gut it out with p lanned blackouts lets use the blackouts against the generators michae l shames head of the san diegobased utility consumers action network to ld the energy utilities and communications committee but shames and other s stressed the need for warnings of at least hours and blackouts no long er than minutes absent that management of blackouts we dont see how the buyers cartel could work shames said on a visit to chicago on mon day davis said he talked to officials about the citys system for giving t he public warning days before possible power blackouts with definite notic e right before there is no reason to keep that secret from the public wh en their safety is likely to be jeopardized davis told reporters tuesday the governor said he plans to meet in the next few days with managers at i so to explore the idea of a system like chicagos the grid operator annou nced monday that it will try to give the public at least a halfhour notice of outages but many officials said tuesday the public needs even more war ning davis aides said the governors plan will go beyond isos there are potential pitfalls criminals might make their own plans taking advantage of deactivated alarms and some say that a schedule of blackouts might inc rease the number of outages if people have been warned that a blackout is coming and a lastminute supply of electricity makes it unnecessary grid managers would have to decide whether to call it off said dorothy rothroc k vice president of the california manufacturers technology association if they did it would add uncertainty to future warnings she said possi bly leading them to order unnecessary blackouts obviously there are tra deoffs rothrock said still the idea of planning blackouts seems to be gaining ground as a way for the state to get back some control of the ener gy crisis sorely lacking in recent months it would help us as californi ans to say the hell with you george bush were going to handle this our selves said jim overman of elk grove overman said he has been bu rning up the phone lines trying to persuade anyone who will listen that sch eduled blackouts will make everyones lives easier briggs said he has bee n told by constituents including irrigators and food processors that sche duled blackouts are the way to go irrigators would know that they shouldn t plan on getting water on a day that their electronic gates might be clos ed businesses could tell workers to stay home on a blackout day or arran ge for backup power generators he said we would be very interested in i t said ed yates senior vice president of the california league of food p rocessors power blackouts are chaotic for processing plants yates said requiring some plants to be resterilized and shutting down operations for more than a day some processors might choose to close on days when they f aced a blackout he said losing revenue but avoiding the loss of thousands of pounds of food it doesnt solve the problem but it helps manage a v ery difficult situation he said briggs said that his plan would result in possible blackout days every two weeks the plan would assume that a cer tain number of customers would have to turned off to keep the grid operatin g if the electricity shortage went above that amount people might still f ace unanticipated blackouts briggs said one question is public safety s ome are queasy about burglars knowing when blackouts will occur but pluses include the ability to arrange for temporary stop signs at road intersecti ons or families being able to arrange for a sick relative to be moved i f the police have only five minutes notice they cant get to difficult int ersections to direct traffic they cant help paramedics fire departments and ambulances get where they have to be davis said the manufacturers association and other business groups havent endorsed the idea yet but sa y its

construction in baja cali fornia has become one of the most immediate solutions to californias elect ricity shortfalls at least three plants being built in baja california in the next four years will send electricity north of the border where blacko uts have interrupted normal activity one facility a sempra energy corp power plant near mexicali will export all of its electrical output to cons umers north of the border the san diego companys project gained quick app roval from mexican authorities because the facility is not subject to restr ictions imposed on private companies that supply electricity to the mexican market other mexican energy officials have said several other enterprise s are interested in building similar facilities in baja california such a mushrooming of projects is prompting concern on both sides of the border t hat the plants might have harmful effects on natural resources and public h ealth and safety in his speech martens emphasized mexicos commitment to preserving the environment and local communities but afterward he said mexico will approve any number of baja california projects to serve califor nia consumers i dont see any limit the only limit is the ability of th e interconnecting lines to transmit the electricity that is produced he s aid with a capacity of only megawatts each the two transmission inte rconnections linking the electricity grids of california and baja californi a will not be able to transmit all of the megawatts of electricity fo r the california market produced by the new baja california plants let a lone any

analyzing wh at capacity it has for transmitting supplies on its lines and how to assess tariffs for the service its become very important because of our proxi mity to mexico said district spokesman

we can do in the short term in the long term you can almost see what will be coming down the pike as the states energy problems worsen as the state throws its surplus down a rathole as our own utility bills skyrocket and as blackouts roll across the state someone will write a statewide ballot initiative and get it on the ballot it will do two things first it will undo the deregulation of the states energy industry it wil l try to put everything back the way it was second it will punish the producers of power and energy it will levy some new fee or tax or it will regulate the industry as a publ ic utility or it will require that the state take over the industry entirel y huge amounts of money will be spent against it opponents will outspend sup porters by a substantial amount tv ads will run constantly predicting dire consequences if the initiative is approved well be told it will be bad for business labor leaders will tell us that it will cost jobs experts will say it will have no effect on the problem or make the problem worse all of that will probably be true the initiative will pass easily it will pass because it will appear to address what are widely understood a s the two main causes of the current energy crisis a badly bungled dereg ulation and unbelievably greedy energy producers it will pass because the initiatives authors will understand that most of us are furious about the way this mess was created and that were eager to take it out on the industry leaders we see as the leading villains it will pass precisely because all the people who will tell us it shouldnt are the people who got us into this disaster in the first place and we wo nt believe them its much harder to say whether the energy crisis will have more immediate political repercussions for some of the elected officials we might blame fo r the problem such as the state legislature and gov davis who could ha ve done something about this a year ago and chose not to yes the latest polls make it clear that californians are furious with davi s and the legislature but elections for office are not yesno propositions you dont get to vo te up or down on davis they are a contest between two major party candidates which means election s are always a matter of comparisons davis compared with his opponent s omeone has to come along and convince voters he or she can do the job bette r than davis there might indeed be such people its unlikely one of those people will appear on the ballot in however the current political landscape is heavily populated with profiles in disco uragement people who fearful of losing lack the nerve to run against a wellfinanced incumbent the great irony here is that voters thought term limits would solve that pr oblem rather than being stuck with a wellfinanced

in those six to ei ght years it has done nothing to embolden wouldbe candidates now they j ust meekly wait their turn and it has made a shambles of the legislative process by populating the cap itol

palatable davis deal some have complained is sweeter for southern c alifornia edison than for taxpayers so at least four proposals are being f loated to supplant that plan but legislators are far from a consensus on a ny of them plans emerge recede and are reconfigured daily energy expert s and bankruptcy lawyers warn that too much legislative fiddling could resu lt in what neither side wants bankruptcy for edison bankruptcy means the state would be stuck buying energy until both edison and pacific gas ele ctric which is already in bankruptcy complete the chapter process w hich could take years experts and lawmakers said the states wallet woul d shrink affecting its ability to build schools and roads ratepayers migh t be on the hook for an additional billion for the companys legal fees because bankruptcy would freeze its assets said brian bennett vice presi dent of edison international the utilitys parent company southern calif ornia edison has said its willing to be flexible on the governors plan w hich calls for the state to buy edisons transmission grid for billio n company officials wouldnt comment on the various alternatives we und erstand that the transmission deal is the subject of controversy and are op en to variations on it bennett said steve maviglio davis spokesman said the governor also remained committed to his deal edison is going to survive said mitch wilk a member of the state public utilities commiss ion from through and a past president of the agency but the ques tion is whether it will survive via the plan that the governor negotiate d or they do the same kind of thing pge did there is still a very real risk that sce will be forced into bankruptcy if the legislature tinkers to o much with the deal or fails to move ahead promptly wilk said pge c hose to file chapter last month because it was dissatisfied with the pro gress of negotiations with davis on a state rescue of the company pges m ove was an embarrassment for davis who had vowed to keep the states big u tilities solvent one of the principal chips edison has with the state is not filing for bankruptcy said ed feo a lawyer involved with the pge case it would be a black eye for the state as long as the company stays out of bankruptcy they have something to trade edisons creditors are s till waiting to see how the utility fares with the legislature some have a greed to defer receiving payments until the end of june dean vanech pres ident of new jerseybased carson cogeneration said a lot of things need to happen before he and other creditors feel ready to drag edison into bankru ptcy in general we would have to feel like there was absolutely no hope in a deal being made vanech said but he admitted theres a concern that a resolution will not be put on the table in any reasonable period of timemeanwhile edison has vigorously lobbied the legislature to approve the transmission deal the company has launched a publicrelations campaign to persuade the public that it is in its interest said john bryson chief executive of edison international bankruptcy is a last resort bryson said in a recent interview we believe there will be a solution but c hanges are necessary said senate leader john burton dsan francisco bec ause people didnt like plan a lawmakers cringed at some elements of th e plan which many thought was overly generous to edison limiting investig ation of the utilitys parents company and guaranteeing the company an percent annual return on investment alternatives include requiring pow er generators to accept up to onethird less than the collective billi on theyre owed taxing edison on its property and using the tax to pay off its debts and allowing edison to build more power plants the latest prop osal would require the state to sell bonds to pay off edisons debts and gi ve the state the option to buy the transmission lines later most of the pr oposals would require an extra surcharge on ratepayers bills to pay off deb ts one hurdle the legislature faces rallying twothirds of each house be hind one plan necessary any time the state spends money republicans have been philosophically opposed to acquiring transmission lines and half the alternatives include that element but stanford university professor james sweeney thinks compromise is possible lawmakers and the utility will stri ke a deal simply because a second bankruptcy would tarnish the image of the states political leaders sweeney believes however the outcome might be more fair in court bankruptcies are messy but so is the political p rocess sweeney said were in a situation where the leadership politic ally seems not willing to bite the bullet it may be better for our state to have a bankruptcy judge who is very strong and who isnt planning for a higher office long beach obtains lien on edisons assets the city is the fourth sm all supplier with an attachment on the utility may by kate berr y the orange county register the city of long beach became the fourth smal l power supplier to get a lien against the assets of southern california ed ison a move that could push the utility closer to bankruptcy last week edison was ordered to freeze at least million in bank accounts to cover payments owed to long beach for power edison bought from the citys trasht oenergy plant getting a lien on the utilitys assets ensures the city wi ll be paid even if the utility files for bankruptcy stephen pickett edi son internationals general counsel said the utility plans to appeal lon g beach also is suing edison international the utilitys parent company f or breach of contract claiming the utility should not have transferred billion to its parent company over a fouryear period beginning in when deregulation was implemented edison international was required to h onor the debts of its subsidiary said robert shannon long beachs city attorney so far edison has been sued by small power suppliers known as qualifying facilities or qfs the lawsuits either seek to put a lien on the utilitys assets to recover unpaid debts or attempt to terminate ye ar contracts to provide power to edison edison owes qfs about billion and is trying to combine the cases before a single judge in los angeles b ut long beach differs from other power suppliers because it wants to stay i n its contract with edison we just want to be paid under our contract w e still want to deliver them power said shannon as a municipality lon g beach also did not have to post a bond to obtain a lien as the other qfs must ed feo a lawyer for wind solar and biomass qfs said liens on edis ons assets could have a domino effect two things will accelerate a bank ruptcy filing by edison either the deal to sell its transmission lines to the state is going nowhere and alternatives are not acceptable or if at tachments are made to the companys property that the utility doesnt want to run the risk of losing three other qfs have posted bonds to obtain l iens against edison they include caithness energy which got a lien on edi sons percent interest in two qualifying facilities that make up the moh ave generating station in laughlin nev imc chemicals a unit of imc glob al inc

russell city energy center in hayward calif the filing marks the beginning of an extensive cec licensi ng process required to build and operate an electricity generating facility in california the filing included a request for expedited review that would reduce the licensing review process period from months to months the proposed russell city energy center would be a megawatt natural gasfired combinedcycle electric generating facility located on approximately acres of land zoned heavy industrial at enterprise avenue in hayward the site is adjacent to the city of haywards wastewate r treatment plant which would supply recycled water to the energy center th e russell city energy center would provide needed electricity for hayward western alameda county and the san francisco peninsula the modern technology used at the facility would allow for a greater than percent reduction of certain emissions and is percent more fuelefficient compared to older gasfueled facilities in the bay area the russell city energy center will provide a vital new source of clean reliable electricity in the region said curt hildebrand vice president a nd general manager of the calpinebechtel joint development we look forward to working with the city of hayward alameda county and the california energy commission to develop a model energy center submittal of the afc represents the

speed up the process of approving constru ction of new power plants as a way to fight the ongoing power shortage california is in a war with energy producers and the best longterm weapo n is to build more power plants davis said at a signing ceremony in elk grove california the bill will shorten the application process for a new or remodeled power plant as well as the time that local governments have to review proposals davis said the new bill will speed up two energy projects that are in the process right now including a megawatt plant in palm springs and a gas storage project in lodi that will store up to billion cubic feet of natu ral gas california has been suffering from a power crisis since last year which ha s caused repeated blackouts and sent the power rate spiraling the crisis is largely blamed on the deregulation law that forces the utilities to buy electricity from the wholesale market at higher rates than they charge the customers and the repairs of generators in some power plants an d the warming weather have made things worse after the heavily indebted utilities could no longer afford to buying power anymore the state government has used more than billion dollars of tax m oney so far this year to buy electricity on behalf of them among other measures to ease the power shortage the state government has c alled for residents to conserve electricity as much as they can especially durin g the peakhours during the dayresidents have been told to brace for a worse situation during the incoming summer from the oakland tribune lockyer probe may spark suit criminal charges could follow evidence of price gouging by steve geissinger sacramento bureau sacramento state attorney general bill lockyer said wednesday his invest igation of alleged

guilty about it ever s ince because im a prosecutor and i take pride in being careful about these sorts of accusations or claims but i know it wont be in print unless i find some sort of colorful way to pump up the rhetoric he said we dont care if theyre multimillionaires we dont care if they run big corporations theyre buccaneers theyre ripping us off now while were still in the legal analysis of whether its legal or ille gal greed its clearly immoral theres no debate about that lockyer said his investigators are scrutinizing tens of thousands of transa ctions and hundreds of thousands of documents to determine the strength of the states case i think there is strong evidence that lays the foundation for a successful civil action but the whole house hasnt been built lockyer said a civil case could result in refunds that disgorge the obscene profits h e said the california independent system operator which manages the states elect ric transmission grid estimates that power suppliers

of atlanta the three companies agreed tuesday to surrender copies of internal document s that had been subpoenaed two months ago by lockyer as part of the probe theyve been throwing anhour lawyers at

mercury stories below regards steve surplus power sold at a loss electricity cool summer and effective conservation efforts result in exces s supplies industry officials say its a routine move by nancy vogel times staff writer july sacramento caught with an excess of electricity as a result of cool weat her and heavy conservation the state government sold power at a loss appro aching million in the first days of july the loss amounts to roughly of the total amount the state spent on pow er during that period to keep power flowing to million californians the state purchased m illion megawatthours at an average price of per megawatthour accord ing to the state department of water resources it sold off surplus megawatthours at an average price of per megawatthour department of water resources director thomas hannigan disclosed the details in respo nse to an inquiry by assemblyman john campbell rirvine the sales of surplus power get to the issue of do these people really kno w what theyre doing are they really competent to be managing this to the lowest cost for the ratepayers campbell said it reinforces to me that w e should get the state out of doing this as soon as practically possible industry officials however say it is routine for utilities and electricit y companies to at times find themselves with more electricity than their cu stomers need they either sell the power at a loss work out an exchange of power or give it away its not all that uncommon for utilities to be buying one day and selling the next said one pacific northwest trader who asked not to be identified because his company does not permit him to talk to reporters he said a ru le of thumb in the industry is to match supply to demand within to a lthough on a load like california isnt that much assemblyman roderick wright dlos angeles chairman of the assembly utili ties committee said he did not see a problem with dwrs power sales right now the summer is cool he said if this had been a normal july w e would have used all that power the worm could have turned the other way department of water resources spokesman oscar hidalgo said the states crew of power purchasers found themselves selling a very minimal amount of electricity in may in june more power was sold but less than was sold i n july he said the department has not released those figures department officials expect the sales to stop if temperatures heat up later this week the water department was thrust into the role of buying to of the s tates overall electricity in january after the states major utilities bec ame so financially crippled by high wholesale electricity prices that energ y companies refused to sell to them the department has so far spent roughly billion of taxpayer money purcha sing power that is sent to the customers of pacific gas electric souther n california edison and san diego gas electric hidalgo said the sales show that the water department has stabilized the st ates electricity market the average price the department has paid for a m egawatthour is falling from in may to in june to so far in july if we were out scrambling for power right now hidalgo said the market would reflect that and adjust to it and we would most likely be paying muc h more in overall purchases campbell said he assumes the department sold its most expensive marginal m egawatts of power but hidalgo said that is not necessarily so the departm ent does not track what it paid for the power it sells he said the departments statement to campbell shows sales to different companie s including the federal bonneville power administration the los angeles d epartment of water and power and several private energy companies that bou ght power plants from californias utilities under the states deregul ation

mercury news state figures sho w california may have lost about million this month selling surplus ele ctricity for less than it cost the mercury news disclosed last week that some power was being sold at a loss but the new figures provide the first indication of just how much excess power the state bought in its desperate effort to avoid blackouts and how cheaply some of that power was sold wh en it turned out not to be needed a republican lawmaker said monday the l oss also shows democratic gov gray davis energy policies are needlessly c osting consumers ``this whole thing is a mess said assemblyman john ca mpbell rirvine who requested details of the states surplus power sales ``the government needs to get out of the power business before it costs ca lifornians even more money a state spokesman didnt dispute the mil lion figure outright but said it is an approximation based on average price s and that the actual loss probably is less ``its a number im sure he l ikes very much but its definitely an estimated number and it could be fa r lower said oscar hidalgo spokesman for the state department of water resources campbell responded that the loss also could be higher the sta te has spent million on power so far this month state officials last week confirmed that cool weather and consumer conservation have left calif ornia holding more power than it needs the revelation was a stunning turna round for a state that months ago was paying top dollar for power expectin g shortages this summer price that was paid the state bought million megawatthours of electricity for july at an average price of per meg awatthour according to a response friday by the department of water resou rces to campbells inquiry the state has sold surplus megawatthou rs in july at an average price of the department said based on those average prices the state paid million for the surplus power which it sold for million million less than it cost a more precise calculation of the states loss is difficult because purchased power is acq uired at different times and prices and pooled as a ``portfolio purchas es included longterm contracts that averaged per megawatthour as wel l as cheaper spotmarket buys state officials last week said they were se lling surplus at to a megawatthour while some traders cited uncon firmed sales as low as hidalgo noted that the surplus sales represent just percent of californias july purchases which totaled million the million from sales will help lower the states power bill he said adding that utilities routinely sell some extra electricity ``despite t

allocation policies iso market participants since trade month november which settled beginning in january payment defaults in the iso markets have caused the iso to pay less than th e full amount due scheduling coordinators scs in the monthly cash clearin g process the purpose of this message is to describe the isos policies a nd procedures in settling the market when defaults occur as set forth in section sabp of the iso tariff when payment defaults occur from scs that have obligations to the isos markets debtor scs the shortfall is t o be prorated to scs with net amounts due them creditor scs based on thei r outstanding balances the principles that drive how amounts are settled a nd defaults are allocated to creditor scs are summarized below proportionate allocation of defaults the total amount of market defaults is allocated to the creditor scs on a proportionate basis such that each cr editor sc receives the same percentage of their total net amount receivable for the month scs are allowed to net the credits and debits on a monthly basis as described below the intent of the tariff is to equitably distri bute market shortfalls only to those scs that have net market receivables f or the period each month is treated as a whole period final and preliminary invoices ar e combined when possible see exception conditions below in allocating mar ket defaults cash payments from the market are received in two stages pr eliminary and final at preliminary market payments are distributed base d on the preliminary amounts due to the creditor scs as set forth in the pr eliminary invoices final invoices serve essentially as trueups to the pre liminary invoices and accordingly payments received at final are redistri buted to the extent possible to achieve trueup allocations for the whole m onth considering the combined amounts due the creditor scs from both the pr eliminary and final invoices each month is treated as a discrete period market defaults are generally allocated to the creditor scs that have amounts due for the month being set tled the exceptions to this rule involve scs that are creditor scs in the current month but have default obligations relating to prior periods o r debtor scs that pay in the current month but have unpaid balances for prior months in the first instance the creditor sc would not be paid to the extent of default obligations from prior months amounts due to the c reditor sc would be allocated back to the default period and such proceeds would be allocated based on remaining amounts still owed for that period i n the second instance the current months payment is carried back and appli ed first to the oldest outstanding balance the proceeds would be distribut ed to the creditor scs for that earlier period based on the creditor scs un paid balances in that month with respect to the carry back of payments to the earliest period pre and post bankruptcy debts are deemed to be from d ifferent scs gmc defaults are remedied as a first priority on market payments gmc is billed separately from market billings on both preliminary and final invoic es each month in the event of payment default on any gmc invoices at eit her preliminary or final market funds are transferred to satisfy gmc obli gations before any market distributions are made this first priority posi tion for gmc revenues is set forth in section sabp of the iso tarif f therefore when both gmc and market defaults occur as has occurred in each of the past few months the creditor scs have two reductions to the m arket clearing amounts ultimately paid an allocated portion of the gmc de fault and an allocated portion of the market default rmr invoices and pa yments are not affected by market or gmc defaults the rmr invoicing proce ss involves amounts due from the ptos to the rmr owners as set forth in mo nthly invoices processed through the isos systems however such amounts are invoiced independent of the isos market and gmc billing processes and accordingly market andor gmc defaults do not impact rmr related payments there are a number of factors that complicate the monthly process of alloca ting cash to creditor scs when defaults occur some of these factors inclu de amounts received after payment date deadlines such amounts are typicall y included in the next distribution market payments due to creditor scs that default on gmc in the current mo nth such market allocations are reduced by the specific amount of the gmc default by the creditor sc allocations to prior months not made unless the amount exceeds of that months billed amounts small invoices under are paid in full rather than the allocated pe rcentage for more information about these allocation issues or any other related mat ters please contact

inlinefyi it sounds like this consultants findings are being questioned by many in the industry including by the caisoportland orebased firm says california has capacity for electricity needsdan mcswain north county times escondido calif october oct portland orea private investigation of state power markets has come to the conclusion that california had plenty of electricity generating capacity this summerthe state enjoyed a percent reserve margin even as wholesale prices soared and the states power manager declared separate power emergencies because california was thought to be in the grips of a critical shortage according to the investigationthe author of the investigations preliminary report portlandbased economist and utility industry consultant robert mccullough said at a conference of analysts power traders and electricity industry regulators thursday that he has found evidence that generators and trading companies manipulated the production of power from june through august to create a false shortage and push up pricesthe encina power plant in carlsbad provides a stark example it ran at well below its full capacity for much of june even though wholesale power prices and consumer electricity bills shot to well above the generating plants cost of productionthe actual production of electricity by the plants was determined by an analysis of data from the environmental protection agency which monitors emissionswe are seeing a lot of undergeneration mccullough said this is market power in actionmarket power is a term used by economists to describe the ability of market participants in this case suppliers to influence pricesmany of the industry experts present at the conference thursday reaffirmed their belief that supply shortages were very real this summer and contributed to high prices but several participants said deregulation has reduced the amount of market information that is available to analysts mainstream economists have questioned the accuracy of data from federal agencies including the epaconventional explanations for the low energy production observed in san diego county are scantencinas operators a joint venture of energy giants dynegy inc and nrg energy inc called cabrillo power confirmed that the power plant had no abnormal maintenance problems the san diego regional air quality board said wednesday that the power plant was well within its statemandated pollution limitsbut david lloyd the corporate secretary of cabrillo denied that the encina plant has been used to game the san diego county power marketsthat cant possibly be right lloyd said of mcculloughs analysis in north county we were right on the ragged edge of being off an emergency shutdown because of heavy outputwithout knowing the specific details of time and which units were on or off i cant comment lloyd saidwe certainly dont want to be accused of anything wrongful he said we dont have that much power in california and for us to be shutting down in california to push up the price somewhere else doesnt make sense for us we want to run all we can when the prices are highelectricity prices have soared to record levels since may resulting in a doubling and tripling of power bills this summer for the million customers of san diego gas electric co and causing an estimated billion in losses for southern california edison and pacific gas electricstate lawmakers have intervened on behalf of san diego county consumers with a retail rate cap but the law in turn created a looming iou that could grow beyond million if high wholesale prices persistno fewer than five private state and federal investigations are under way to assess the competitiveness of power markets in the interconnected western states the investigations also seek to answer charges that the companies which produce and trade electricity have either figured out how to exploit deregulated markets to outmaneuver regulators or have engaged in outright manipulation in order to increase profitsinquiries by the california public utilities commission electricity oversight board and attorney general along with a federal energy regulatory commission investigation were launched in july and august staff investigators of the state and federal commissions said this week that they are still in the process of issuing subpoenas and gathering market datamccullough was hired in late may by the seattle city utility and a consortium of large industrial power consumers in the pacific northwest to investigate the price spikes his effort is thought to be the first to complete an exhaustive analysis of state and federal information that tracks the amount of electricity that was available and compares it to the amount of power that was actually usedchief among mcculloughs findings was that demand for power was lower this summer than what was forecasted by the western systems coordinating council a federal agency that is charged with ensuring the stability of the vast web of power transmission lines that connect california to other western states british columbia and northern mexicomccullough provided a copy of his preliminary findings tuesday to the north county times and the initial reaction of the states energy community was one of deep skepticismepa data is notoriously unreliable said frank wolak a stanford professor and the chairman of the market surveillance committee of the california independent system operator the agency that manages the state grid and which has paid enormous sums for emergency power this summer to

were exceeding nameplate capacity these guys were cranking it outwolak in a study of power markets for the system operator did conclude however that exercise of market power by power generators and traders was the major cause of higher prices this summerat the conference in portland most of the panelists did not openly criticize mcculloughs analysis but implicitly disputed his conclusions by attributing higher prices and the presumed exercise of market power to a very real shortage of electricity generating capacity among the western stateslow hydroelectric production in the pacific northwest and high temperatures in the southwest were blamed for limiting californias ability to import electricityothers said state and federal regulators along with market participants themselves wont really know what happened until more experts look at hard market information that is in short supplyron eachus the chairman of the oregon public utilities commission said market information is

steffesnaenronenron cc subject san diego union tribune have you seen this eric powercompany profits climb along with prices by craig d rose uniontribune staff writer october a power company executive yesterday boiled californias ongoing electricity crisis down to the bottom line prices are rising and i know thats hurting consumers but it certain ly has been beneficial for enron said jeffrey skilling president and chief operating officer of the houstonbased energy and tradi ng company enron declined to specify how much it earned from california during the past summer when the states deregulated electricity market sent power prices soaring but the texas company did say that profits of its sales and servic es unit which trades california electricity and o ther commodities increased percent to million dynegy inc also based in houston reported that income from its marketing and trade unit soared more than percent to million steve bergstrom president of dynegy said california was perhaps only the thirdbiggest contributor to that surge but industry analysts said the earnings reports are the first indication of a pattern expected in coming weeks california clearly drove the positive momentum at both of these companies said carol coale senior analyst of prudential securities and you probably just saw the beginning of a string of strong reports from the power industry she and others say they suspect that power companies derived billions in profits from the state where tight supplies set the stage for huge price increases companies did not necessarily have to own generating plants to profit from the deregulated market enron produces no electricity in california but is the nations largest electricity trader buying and selling the outp ut of power plants owned by other companies rep duncan hunter rel cajon said the big profits should be seen in something other than a business context these massive profits by the energy companies translate directly into thousands of san diegans losing savings that were planned for education mortgage payments health care and other necessities hunter said when the state power exchange saw dramatic price increases within a matter of hours it was clear that predatory pricing was producing massive profits for someone hunter said hunter insists that recent powe r prices violate federal law mandating that rates be just and reasonable he is calling for the federal energy regulatory commission to order refunds ferc is scheduled to issue a report on the california market by nov the political fallout from the price increases meanwhile appears to weigh heavily on power companies which are reluctant to tout successes in california for fear of being singled out for profiteering after noting that dynegys recent acquisitions in illinois contributed strongly to the companys success last quarter bergstrom was reminded that he had omitted mention of california illinois is not as politically volatile as california bergstrom said he acknowledged that dynegy did pretty well in california because its pow er plants produced far more electricity this year than last bergstrom also sought to correct an earlier report that dynegy had quickly recouped t he cost of power plants it recently acquired in the state he said that was true only of the plants it owns in long beach and el segundo which it bought in bergstrom said the cost of dynegys half interest in the former san diego gas electric encina power plant in carlsbad acquired at the end of had not been recovered typically plant operators assume that it will take as long as years to recoup such costs in comments to financial analysts skilling of enron suggested that power companies could help provide a solution to californias power problems supply constraints and the resulting price pressures in california and oth er locations have demonstrated the need for skilled marketers like enron to provide reliable power and stable prices skilling said he predicted that californias utility companies which now buy much of their power from other companies would sign longterm contracts to stabilize prices following an approach suggested by many power generators and traders if they were willing to extend the terms of their purchases to year contracts then they could get contracts for a megawatt which is not much different than they were paying two or three years ago skilling said but consumer advocates have noted that longterm contracts at those levels would lock consumers into price increases and leave them with little choice about suppliers advocates of electrical deregulation had predicted that introducing competition would lead to reductions in power costs and to greater consumer choice harry snyder senior advocate for consumers union in san francisco said he was skeptical of solutions proposed by the power industry any proposal from the industry has to be suspect because they have engaged in faking out the california public and price gouging when there are shortages said snyder who advocates an end to deregulation they do not have consumer interests at heart

in the second wave of document productions for portland general the production of the requested documentswould involve a tremendous volume of documents as portland general ownedtwenty generating facilities of a variety of types and sizes during portland general is a net importer of energy and can only generate about onehalf of its total energy demand as a result we question whether theeffort

charts telephone directories or so called family trees forearlier periods they will also make those available one enron entityportland general has published books on its corporate history if a listof those books would be helpful we can provide it with respect to theother enron entities to the extent that corporate histories can be foundthey will be produced we anticipate producing these documents in the firstwave on october requests and the enron entities propose that their responses to requests willidentify their relationship to affiliated companies and the transactiondocuments will identify its customers and suppliers we believe thisinformation will be sufficient to illustrate these relationships for thestaffs purposesfinancial documentsrequests through the enron entities will produce their public filings for the periodrequested with respect to financial data epmi ees and portland generalwill provide to the commission electronic transaction data thetransaction documents for the purchase and sale of energy delivered whichinformation includes economic data we anticipate producing public filingsregarding financial data on october and the electronic transactiondocuments in the second wave of document productionsgenerating documentsrequests and for the enron entities other than portland general the generationfacilities are either nonexistent or limited in number and there willprobably be limited documents available the enron entities to the extentthey act as a scheduling coordinator or possessed the right to use or resellgeneration output do not have the specific documents that pertain to eachgeneration unit requested the enron entities other than portland generaldo have documents and information for las vegas cogeneration we propose toproduce these documents in the second wave of document productions for portland general the production of the requested documentswould involve a tremendous volume of documents as portland general ownedtwenty generating facilities of a variety of types and sizes during portland general is a net importer of energy and can only generate about onehalf of its total energy demand as a result we question whether theeffort required of portland general is warranted as its impact on thecalifornia wholesale market is necessarily limited nevertheless portlandgeneral proposes to provide for year electronic transaction documentsin summary form similar to the data being provided by other enron entitiesto the extent relevant as discussed below we propose that the commissiondefer requesting production of other information until it has reviewed theinformation of generators who sell a significant proportion of their energyinto the california market at that time a more accurate assessment can bemade of whether this enormous effort will be valuable given the limitedimpact of portland general generation on the california wholesale markettransaction documentsrequests and we understand that the commission will be obtaining trading data forthe purchase and sale of energy delivered in california from the iso and pxepmi can provide the commission several different sets of relevanttransaction data for year in california and outside of california andreal time for the purchase and sale of energy delivered with the datecounterparty quantity delivery point hours price and whether it is apurchase or a sale because of the speed with which you want thisinformation it is possible that some entries will be incomplete orinaccurate for thosetransactions where epmi served only as the scheduling coordinator weunderstand that the iso will show part of the transaction but there willnot be a corresponding transaction in the epmi data we can provide quicklythe reason is that this type of transaction is passed through to epmiscustomer on an accounting system rather than as part of the tradingbusiness ees can also provide similar data with respect to relevantwholesale and retail transactions with the proviso that with respect toretail transactions it will not include the specific names of its retailcustomers but instead will provide a blind customer number due to eesconfidentiality obligations to those customers we anticipate producing thetransaction documents in the second wave of document productionsferc documentsrequest the enron entities will produce the requests for data they receivedfrom ferc and to the extent that ferc has been given responses copies ofthose responses we anticipate producing the ferc documents on october based upon discussions that we have had with the various enronentities we believe that we could make a second wave of productions onfriday october it is possible that not all enron entities couldmake that date but we believe the bulk of the data could be available forproduction by then we propose to make these productions with the understanding that ifany entity obtains a more stringent protective order than the one currentlyin place that all of the enron entities document productions will beprotected by the most stringent protective order in addition if at therequest of any party or nonparty to this proceeding the commission or acourt of competent jurisdiction orders that the requests for production belimited reduced or eliminated the enron entities reserve the right tolimit the production of documents in conformance with such order

iso__pricecaps ::::::>>>>>> data privileged and confidentialattorney client privilegerichard i am following up on the electronic data from tim do we have anymore progress yet i also met with mike day yesterday to discuss his views on strategyfor opposing the subpoena if it becomes necessary he added an importantfact he said that because the cpuc is a california constitutionallycreated entity they take the view that they need not go to superior courtfor enforcement of their orders while williams and others are claimingthat they should michael believes it much much more likely that theprocedural course will be for the alj to enter a decision and order whichthe full commission may but need not consider if the commission does nottake up the aljs order at that point we would be left with seeking a writof mandate at the court of appeals level in other words if the cpuc takesthat view then there may be no de novo review anywhere outside of the cpucthis is because orders of the cpuc are only reviewable at the court ofappeals level thus there may be no need for the commission to even bothertrying to find a favorable judge in san diego since the commission alreadyhas the contempt power in short this wrinkle seems to make the aljapproach even less appealing than before williams however is stillpressing apparently on the theory that the cpuc should go to superior court michael also had a suggestion for a back channel approach to the agthat was raised on the governmental affairs side of the house that might beuseful to discuss next weekthanksgarythis email message is for the sole use of the intended recipients and may contain confidential and privileged information any unauthorized review use disclosure or distribution is prohibited if you are not the intended recipient please contact the sender by reply email and destroy all copies of the original messageto reply to our email administrator directly send an email to postmasterbrobeckcombrobeck phleger harrison llphttpwwwbrobeckcom 
iso__pricecaps ::::::>>>>>> some thoughts on options privileged and confidentialattorney client privilegerichard after todays discussion here are our brainstorming ideas onoptions wait for a better protective order ask harvey morris where they are on fixing the protective order thatis being litigated by others if the protective order has not changedthen unilaterally postpone production until it is pro better protectionand more time con even with a more stringent protective order enron still questions whether the puc is entitledto financial performance data thus this option does not fullydisclose all of enrons positions and the company may be accused later ofsimply engaging in delaying tactics under this option we file ourformal objections as well turn over the transaction data as is continue on our present course of turning over transaction data forelectricity that was delivered pro puc will get the data anywayeither through ferc unfair competition antitrust or price gouginglitigation by turning over the data that will show profits puc mightslow down investigation there as opposed to interrupting the business byseeking to depose witnesses etc con this would be waiving thelegitimate question that enron has as to the pucs ability to discovery thisinformation through a subpoena there is also a question of howconfidential this data would be given the current political agenda itmight also serve to whet the appetite of the puc for more enroninformation and discovery this option would also provide confidentialproprietary information to the puc about how enron gets its competitiveadvantage turn over data for outside of california and let puc get rest ofdata from iso and px we have told the puc we do not want to duplicate the efforts of isoand px so the way to relieve the burden on us is to give only missingdata pro it would be easier and quicker to just give the outside ofcalifornia data and would sidestep for the moment the ongoing jurisdictional question con without enroncost data for the california iso and px transactions the puc would not be able to arrive at what they want a profit and losspicture we would have a hard time representing to the puc that thecombination of the puc data and the enron data would be all that they needto calculate the answers to request nos turn over everything but price this option would simple omit the price data pro it would notreveal the profit and loss information con it would not reveal theprofit and loss information in other words the puc is clear that this iswhat they are after by giving them everything else we would in effect be telling them we will not turn over profit andloss moreover by piecing some of it together with the iso and pxdata the puc might be able to put together a revenue picture which will bequite large but just not the cost or expense side decline to produce the data we would tell harvey morris that enron has reconsidered its positionfor the following reasons our firm belief that the puc is notentitled to the profit and loss data they are seeking in his latestemail harvey has made it clear that the puc wants more data than we discussed earlier continued threat that if they do not like thetransaction data they will come back and ask for profit and lossinformation that we do not believe they are entitled to commissionerwoods statement that the purpose of this investigation is to getmoney from market participants in the hands of consumers investigationby the ag into activities of other market participants and the noticethat other governmental agencies are cooperating who are we producingthis information to and for what purpose enron favors publicdisclosure of trading data but only if all participants are required todo so enron is a small player in this market and many other marketparticipants are not involved in the process bpa etc pro thismay be the only way to preserve enrons challenge to the jurisdiction of thepuc to get this data moreover in the current politicalenvironment there is no assurance where this information will be leaked italso makes sense to see what ferc will do with their published report on investigation date under this option we file our formalobjections and sit back and wait me too upon reflection we agree with the approach taken by the othermarket participants we will not produce until the protective order ismodified and then only data that is within the puc jurisdiction pro thismakes it look like all the market participants are acting in concertand really is no different than option above moreover if you readreliants responses they appear ready to turn over financial data ifthe protective order is modified terry and mike day are both out of theiroffices today note that williams is adopting a strategy that saysthe puc needs to go to superior court to enforce its subpoena this may bemet with strong opposition by the puc given their californiaconstitutional contempt authority move to quash before the alj here we would raise all of the arguments that we have about why thepuc does not have jurisdiction and fight it out on the merits before thealj pro the alj is a forum to raise the jurisdictional questions ithas the least procedural risks of being dismissed con readingthe tea leaves we believe it unlikely that the alj will determine that thepuc has no jurisdiction moreover because the puc has its own constitutionally grantedcontempt power the puc will take the view according to mike day thatthey need not go to the superior court for enforcement they will also takethe view that the superior court has no jurisdiction to hear ourappeal appeals have to go to the puc and those orders are appealable atthe court of appeal level thus the only de novo review of ourobjections might be at the alj level file declaratory relief action in federal court in california we would claim federal question jurisdiction under the federal poweract and in particular the provisions of g under which the pucissued its subpoena in part the dispute to be decided is whether the puchas the jurisdiction to seek the profit and loss information from thewholesale market the authority for this would be mississippi power lightv mississippi us bright line between wholesale market regulatedby ferc and the retail market regulated by states bristol energy corp vnew hampshire fd st cir federal question whether stateagency can inquire into business and financial data in the wholesalemarket but found no cognizable claim pro the federal forum may be moreeven handed than the alj but the question is whether we can state acognizable claim there may be greater protections from disclosure of theinformation as well con the puc may continue on a parallel track unlesswe are able to obtain injunctive relief the puc might seek discovery ofthe same information in the federal court proceeding we should assume thatthis action will trigger the strongest response from the puc andor the agin form of further investigations or alternative forums for getting the sameinformation eg unfair business practice suit price gougingantitrust etc we should anticipate deposition requests for tradersetc by taking this position we will clearly be conceding that ifferc asks for the data it is germane to their authority separate responsesstrategies for different enron entities it may make some sense to chart a different course for portlandgeneral ees and eemc and continue to produce some data from thoseentities pro the information provided for these entities is not likelyto generate profit and loss information that would be germane to the fightwe are about to engage in eg eess description of off tariff rates forexample for portland general dave aamodt is out of the

iso__pricecaps ::::::>>>>>> fw davis press release on ferb report perspective on california and refundsgovernor davis comments on federal energy regulatory commissions reportthe following is a transcript of governor gray davis remarks on the federalenergy regulatory commissions ferc reportmy goal is to keep the lights on and to keep the price of electricityaffordable that is more of a challenge than you might imagine in thiscomplicated deregulated world we find ourselves in i believe we are makinga good startlast year i was able to sign legislation that basically stabilized rates insan diego and i supported hundreds of millions of dollars for renewablepower resources like the photovotaic program you see behind us to supportfinancially and also encourage voluntary support for conservation programsup and down the state to reduce californias use of electricity by whenwe had a stage two alert and to encourage demand management programs by anumber of industries including the technology and grocery industry thatreduce the demand on any given dayhaving said all that this market is dysfunctional it is a very difficultenvironment for deregulation to work and i repeat again deregulation canwork but only if all parties act responsibly and if the market iscompetitive which it is noti was pleased to see that secretary richardson agrees with me that thismarket is dysfunctional and i am also somewhat pleased by the initialreports of the action that ferc took today it is a mixed blessing they dorecognize that we are operating in a dysfunctional market and they do agreethat the rates are not just or reasonable however they did not as iencouraged order rebates to the consumers and businesses in san diego whowere literally gouged and for the profiteering and market manipulation thatsan diego had to suffer throughferc also decided to abolish the stakeholder boards at the isoindependentservice operator and the power exchange ferc agrees with me that they areselfserving and either contributed to or participated directly in marketmanipulation however it is unclear what will replace those boards thegood news is that they agree with our premise that the market isdysfunctional rates are unreasonable and unjust the bad news is there isno immediate remedy for ratepayers here in californiai believe the marketplace generally makes good decisions but i am not goingto be a prisoner of ideology i do not want some knee jerk reactions todrive our economy or our consumers to their knees i have seen time andagain the most right wing conservatives in san diego that say please giveus money to bail us out from the increased prices that have descended uponus so as i have long understood economics drives politics and at themoment we are shipping about billion more out of this state forelectricity than we paid about months ago that has got to stopquestion inaudibleit appears that the ferc said they are going to restructure it and thisagain suggestes the complexity that we have to deal with once the statederegulated distribution from power generation in the puc basicallysurrendered most of its control over the purchase and acquisition ofelectricity for california and that control reverted to the federal energyregulatory commission as i read the initial reports from the ferc decisiontoday they are saying the iso and the power exchange are dominated by stakeholder members and they think that is ill advised as do i there will benew boards established and we will tell you how they are established so itis unclear whether we have the authority to independent of the ferc toestablish our own iso and power exchange my initial reading of the pressreports suggest that we may not that is something that has to be cleared upover the next several daysquestion inaudiblewe have had a series of meetings over the past two months with all kinds ofstakeholders from turn to utilities to generators other consumer groupsfrom san diego and we are trying to forge a consensus which will indicatethe path that we will take i am not at the point where i can tell you whatthat consensus is but we are making progressquestion inaudiblethat we are going to fight for consumers that they should not bear thefull brunt of this experiment in deregulation at best it was premature andthe market place was not prepared the marketplace is dysfunctional it isnot competitive there is a far greater demand for electricity than we cangenerate in this state i want them to know that we are working night andday to find a solution that will ensure that they are not the guinea pigsfor this illconceived schemei am pleased that ferc has recognized that the marketplace isdysfunctional recognized that rates are unjust and unreasonable i am notpleased that they have not offered any solutions it looks like we are goingto have to wait until november th at the hearing in front of ferc at whichtheir full plan will be unveiled and there will be a chance to commentcritique and modify and then thirty days after that the plan will be adoptedin full or in part this is a very important meeting in which ouradministration will be fully represented and i hope to be able to inform theconsumers of this state more fully at the conclusion of that meeting if notbeforei believe refunds are due and necessary ferc and the secretary of energyhave concurred with my assessment that these rates are not just andreasonable and i believe that ferc has the power to order refunds it isunclear whether they believe they have the power to do it or not congresscould settlethe question by simply passing legislation to ensure that over the longhaul by that i mean to to years i believe deregulation can workbut only if we have a competitive marketplace and if all parties actresponsibly as i told everyone involved in this process some people maywin the battle but lose the war if they insist on gouging every consumer andcitizen of this state the people of california will stand up they willrise up and take matters into their own hands the problem with deregulationlowering rates is that we have not seen them and frankly none are on theimmediate horizonquestion inaudiblelet me just say two things i think there is plenty of blame to go aroundbut there is no question that the generators who happen to be outofstatecompanies are charging us to more for the very same electricitythat we purchased last year you cannot add value to an electron anelectron is an electron they are simply taking advantage of an illadvisedscheme envisioned in the act to charge what the market will bear i amstanding up and saying no more we are not going to take this lying down weare fighting back the difficulty is that we do not have the power that weused to have the state surrendered a lot of that power when governor wilsonsigned the deregulation bill actually carried by jim brulte and co authoredby steve peace they were the two driving forces as they will be happy wellmaybe not so happy to acknowledge it may have seemed like a good idea in but i did not participate in that debate and i dont have a comment onwhether it was a good idea then but clearly in the year it is not agood idea again our problem is we can describe the problem and we have somelimited authority over the power the utilities have not yet sold off to thegenerators which is about of their facilities that they used to ownand we do not have control over the facilities they have sold off to the outof state generators that purchased them ferc has control over them and itis unclear whether we even have control to establish our own iso and our ownpower exchange and if we did i would have them reconstituted there is noquestion about that they are too self serving too inbred and too incestuousand do not represent consumer interests plus you cannot hold anyoneaccountable there is no one public official on any one of those boards youcannot hold anyone accountable and they determine largely what the price ofelectricity is and how any shortages are allocated throughout the state sothese are serious responsibilities given to these stakeholder boards and nopublic official participates on those boardsquestion inaudibleyou are more right than wrong as the chief executive of this state i amgoing to advocate what i believe is in the best interests of our consumersand businesses electricity is the lifeblood of our economy without waterand electricity consumers and businesses are just simply out of luckwhether or not this deregulatory scheme in made sense then is aquestion not worth debating today but it does not make sense todayunfortunately that plan adopted by our legislature and governor wilson in surrendered control over generating facilities that the puc used tomonitor and supervise so it is unclear how much power is left to the stateferc seems to be suggestingtoday not much obviously as governor of this state i want to assert asmuch authority as i possibly can because i know i will be held accountableand obviously i would like the authority to go along with the responsibilitythat is laid at my doorstepi have one goal in mind to do our level best to make sure that our lightsstay on and our economy has the benefit of the electricity it needs and theprices are reasonable what path we take to that matters less to me thanthat we get to that result because that is the result that is necessary toallow consumers to go about their lives and business to function and make aprofit and hire more people and to sustain our economic growth which in turnprovides the resources that allow us to finance the schools and protect theenvironment and provide healthcare without electricity there is no economicgrowth without

for billions without fear of retribution higley said public citizens reaction served to underscore concerns voiced by ferc regulators that the consumer backlash spurred by californias flawed market design will work against continuing efforts by federal and state policymakers to further deregulate us electricity markets public citizen also called for the us justice department to launch an

california consumers or the utility industry is back in the control of state officials after a federal commission this week failed to even address the problem the federal energy regulatory commission declared wednesday that california has defects in its deregulated electricity market and proposed sweeping changes but declined to deal with one of the most serious problemsthe summers electricity crisis forced the states three investorowned utilities to purchase wholesale electricity costing billion more than what they could charge consumers under existing rates southern california edison and pacific gas electric now want consumers to pay the full cost of those purchases in the form of monthly surcharges over the next five yearsa plan that would push into the distant future any hope that deregulation would bring relief to the highcost california electricity market but state officials and wall street experts doubt the industry has any realistic chance of collecting all billion despite their confident public stand the utilities will likely settle with consumers id say the chances of utilities being made whole is zero and the chances of them eating all the undercollections is zero said steve fetter an analyst with debt raters fitch of new york fetter is former chairman of the michigan public service commission a high state official who asked not to be named said a majority of the public utilities commission believes that utilities are not entitled to the billion under current law the commission has interpreted the law the same way five times in a row the official said so if anything is to change the legislature will have to write new law and yet division within the puc has been evident lately adding to the confusion despite repeated puc declarations that sce and pge cannot raise rates under the current deregulation law the utilities were encouraged when puc president loretta lynch said on oct that the basic assumptions underlying ab are ripe for reconsideration the electricity cost issue is a political hot potato that california politicians and regulators clearly hoped the federal energy regulatory commission would handle by declaring costs unjust and unreasonable and by ordering generators to give back profits but ferc said it found no evidence of specific market abuses and that it lacked the legal authority to order refunds of federallysanctioned wholesale rates in the absence of marketpower evidence early next year after a new state legislature is sworn in and gov gray davis appoints his third of five members on the state public utilities commission lawmakers officials and stakeholders will have to hammer out an agreement which will probably require a new law wall street is already signaling its impatience our position has been that it is an unsettled situation as far as utilities are concerned said richard cortright a director at standard poors debtrating service that downgraded its outlook on california utility debt to negative last summer consumer groups on the one side are clamoring for the utilities and power companies to pony up for the costs of a failed experiment in a free market for electrons while on the other side the utilities who want full restitution from customers for the electricity they dutifully delivered at going market rates what ferc effectively did was say to california you guys have to choose between utilities and consumers said douglas heller consumer advocate at the santa monicabased foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights its up to gov davis and the legislature to do the right thing and stand up to these utility companies fercs proposed order really passed the buck and left the puc with clear jurisdiction over the utilities transition costs said bob finkelstein a lawyer with the utility reform network the san francisco consumer group has proposed that the puc require the utilities to use sharply increasing profits earned through deregulation such as from the sale of power into the market to pay off the cost of electricity that they have not been able to pass along to customers utilities will argue just as strenuously that to make them absorb the unexpected costs of a vital service is unfair and would impinge on needed investments in electric infrastructure pge and sce have each petitioned the state public utilities commission for permission to begin collecting those billions of dollars by approving rate increases in sces case the proposed rate increase would be no more than which would add about to the typical monthly residential bill although wholesale electricity rates have risen dramatically sce and pge customers are still protected by a rate freeze until utilities pay off costs related to stranded assets such as nuclear wind and other noneconomic assets or until march san diego gas electric got out from under the rate freeze after paying off its stranded assets early in and began passing along wholesale electricity costs directly to customers but the state legislature imposed a rate cap last summer after wholesale rates doubled and tripled causing a political firestorm steve baum chief executive of sdge parent sempra energy said thursday

iso__pricecaps ::::::>>>>>> re important cpuc motion confidential attorney clientprivil ege and work product while i appreciate the virtue of flying below the radar if possible the matter here is complicated by the fact that fercs discovery rules cfr subpart d pertain only to proceedings set for hearing and to such proceedings as the commission may order cfr in this case ferc stated that a trialtype hearing is not necessary and specifically rejected the use of a trialtype evidentiary hearing slip op at n thus while i have not researched the matter as yet my preliminary view is that the cpucs attempt to invoke fercs discovery processes would appear to be outside the contemplation of fercs nov order and its regulations unless ferc specifically orders discovery in this case the cpuc seems to recognize the relevance of this consideration when it specifically attempts to equate paper hearings with trialtype hearings see page of its motionthe cpucs motion may prompt ferc to decide whether or not to allow discovery in this case under rule while the cpucs motion does not apply directly to marketers fercs ruling will be precedent in the event the cpuc or someone else hereafter serves discovery on other parties as a result we need to consider whether laying in the weeds risks losing an opportunity to present our views on whether ferc should allow discovery in a paper hearing with an expedited decisional track particularly in light of the fact that staff has already conducted jeffrey watkiss am does anyone have an idea as to why marketers including epmi are not included in the list of subject companies exh b since epmi is not a subject of the motion why should it answer lying in the weeds may be a more prudent course of action fergus gary s gfergusbrobeckcom pm i just

kafus ::::::>>>>>> lackawanna letter of credit based on my conversation with annellen hornidge last night counsel to bondholders we need to reconsider our strategy regarding how to prevent the million letter of credit from being drawn there is currently a letter of credit issued in the amount of million this letter of credit is to increase by million to a total of million on the completion date although our rights are set forth in the subordinated loan agreement and the subordinated loan agreement contains a definition of completion date the letter of credit uses completion date as defined in the indenture the definition of completion date in the indenture and the subordinated loan agreement both contain references to the epc contract and the required tests they both contain the same language of events that happen in the event that the epc contract is terminated nevertheless although the definitions of completion date in the indenture and subordinated loan agreement are identical there is a subtle difference that could have a severe consequences someone should investigate why this difference occurred enron north america is not a party to the indenture thus for purposes of the indenture the epc contract and the required tests can be amended and changed provided that all parties agreed this would be the trustee and can fibre lackawanna this would be a default under our subordinated loan agreement but we have no remedies for purposes of certification under the letter of credit all the trustee needs to receive is the documentation stating that the completion date has occuredobviously this is not what we want richard and andy please provide your thoughts on how to prevent this from happening my suggestion is that we immediately take control of can fibre via the section proceeding we revoke all authority and notify all parties of such to amend or execute any changes to the epc contract with board approval which would be us we could show some accomadation about any new epc contract but as to the key factors we would stick to the language in the documents that say the test have to be as close to the originalsobviously this has to be scrubbed from a legal perspective regarding how to can control and how to limit our exposure we also need to anticipate any reactions for example changing control is probably a default under the senior loan and they can enforce some remedy the point is that if we do nothing there is a good chance that we lose million we need to be very aggressive

contact harry or i if you need further information david minns our inhouse counsel is actually on vacation until nd january and is not on email during this time you may also be interested to know that we understand glencore a fellow australian coal trading company has received a similar subpoena re trading with aes during this period enron coal asia pacific pty ltd ecap was the counterparty to this deal ecap sold to aes approx metric tonnes of coal as per the contract signed th september the effective date of the agreement was august the actually delivery amount was metric tonnes a the cargo was loaded rd october ecap is incorporated in australia the deal was negotiated by our harry papadopoulos and the contract signed here in sydney by myself heidi mason under delegated authority from stuart staley my delegated authority is based on stus prior approval which in this case was received via email on th september we have a copy of the contract here in sydney but as the coal was bought under lc and such lc was issued out of london all shipping documentation for this load was forwarded to london to the attention of claire veijou and cornelia luptowitsch london office also issued the invoice to aes on behalf of ecap and this was done by rebecca millerchip or maya beyhem also for your information harrry has prior travel plans that put him in china on the date of the hearing while these could be changed it would be less than desirable will it be necessary for the trader to be the enron rep who appears on behalf of the company or could it ideally be someone from houston or london if needs be simply because this is a long way to go for one appearance john bowman has resigned from enron since the time this deal was done and therefore we have not advised him of this action

new york by pt kaltim rima coal who allegedly had a longterm coal purchase agreement with aes barbers point for delivery to aes in hawaii in brief pt contends that aes breached that agreement through the use of a bogus force majeure letter in order to allow aes to purchase coal from some enron entity at a cheaper spot market price in september or october of this year pts attorneys lord bissell brook out of chicago have served us with a subpoena on enron coal company how they decided that enron coal company was the correct entity is not something i yet know i have been advised that enron coal company is a longdormant subsidiary of enron property although using enron coal companys name throughout the subpoena also references harry riaz rizvi allen childress stuart staley andor john bowman i understand that we probably did do a deal maybe more than one with aes but need to be corrected if i am wrong the subpoena requests that a corporate representative for enron coal company appear with documents on january in houston to be deposed about the deal with aes i would like to respond tomorrow by telefax to pts attorneys and advise that enron coal company is the wrong company if all i do is stall them however they can yank the information from us the hard way assuming that we did do the deal in question and eventually get what they want the suit is for about so it is worth the while of pts attorneys to pursue this subpoena accordingly i need one of you to tell me as soon as possible whether a we did such a deal with aes during the relevant time frame and if so the exact name of the enron entity on the deal b who the trader on the deal was and c who has the documents regarding the dealalthough i have briefly described the information i need i also need to get the name

misc ::::::>>>>>> adkins v ena richard today stacy and i spoke with mike farrell adkins attorney it was brief and to the point i told him that his august demand letter makes no reference to a verbal deal for a fixed price done on march that was confirmed in writing by fax to his client on march farrell told me that adkins had not advised him of any such deal farrell who is quick on his feet asked me to send him any writing signed by his client to this effect once he sees that the confirm is the type which does not require a counterparty signature farrell may try to raise a statute of frauds issue given that the deal confirmed could not have been fully performed within one year however there are at least two counterarguments first the underlying base contract that was assigned to ena from ces was signed by adkins in fact to that base contract is attached a confirm for oneyear floating index price deal with an evergreen clause which i think is the deal adkins is trying to enforceand that confirm is signed only by ces second since as john confirmed for me a moment ago we hedged the fixed price deal we may have good promissory estoppel arguments sufficient to trump a statute of frauds argument farrell also mentioned a conversation with wade price in ena customer service during which price advised adkins that adkins in fact had a floating price contract i asked farrell when that conversation occurred and farrell could only say that it ocurred some time in the year stacy and i are following up with price on this preliminarily such a conversation could have occurred however we so far appear to have a very reasonable explanation in brief our back office was drinking from a fire hose during the time of the ces contract assimilation and this and other deals were not getting entered into the correct system for that reason a ena continued to pay adkins based on the old floating index price from some months after march until this and other mispayment issues were caught by an internal audit and b if price had been called by adkins before the corrections were made would have assumed based on what was in the system at the time that the old floating index price contract was still current price keeps a log of phone calls and will be reviewing them in preparation for a further interview by us as stacy mentioned the really interesting point is the timing of adkins purported call although this remains speculation at present adkins would have been losing money for the first several months maybe until around julyaugust as the index was under the fixed price during that time period however adkins may not have been on notice of this until he received the first couple of checks given that payment for appalachian gas runs a month or so slower than elsewhere adkins may not have received those checks until julyaugust by around august the appalachian index price had already risen above the fixed price in other words with the benefit of being several months down the road adkins realized that this was going to be a banner year for appalachian gas prices during the later heating season and was so perhaps adkins called price with an agenda in mind which was to take advantage of what he realized was a mistake by enron timing here again will be important if we coincidentally did not complete our internal audit until the appalachian index price rose above the fixed price deal we had with adkins then adkins will argue that ena opportunistically changed its position on whether there was a deal when the index price rose this is exactly of course our position with regard to adkins stacy will be researching the gas prices during the relevant time frame you should also know that adkins has reportedly done this in the past to our other appalachian gas trader jim javens john learned about this after the fact i will be following up with javens the next step is for me to send to farrell the confirm and any other documentation i want him to see and followup with farrell to attempt to narrow the fact issues i will keep you advised britt

misc ::::::>>>>>> re power systems dave ill get with kevin mike and bob for consensus but first my two cents worth is that this doesnt make sense from a purely commercial standpoint it only makes sense if legal believes it is necessaryive reviewed the proposal and technically have no problems with it commercially however i have some problems first a few facts the permit currently allows for over hours per year a reduction to ppm would allow for an increase to approx hours per year best case heat rate is which is the highest heat rate of all the peakers extra run hours would be more valuable at one of the other tva plants with a lower hr if new albany were a good candidate for combined cycle then the extra run hours would be more valuable but as a simple cycle its difficult to envision needing more than hours though certainly not a representative year this year we ran approx hours at new albany in we ran approximately hours at new albany with the loss of control area status ie parking privileges i would expect this to increase in a typical year but still not significantly above hours any increase in run hours would not be automatic though probable since a permit change would be required this proposal would also clean up some other technical issues flame scanners etc however we have other proposals from psm to clean these up for approx k i leave it up to kevin and rogers to value their run hours but my view is that it is of minimal value and certainly not worth the mm in the proposal im not as familiar with the doyle contract so ive not analyzed for the mm for doylebottom line i recommend going forward only if driven by legal concerns again ill get back to you after ive talked to kevin mike and bobmitchdavid w delaineyect amto mitch robinsoncorpenronenron kevin m prestohouectect mike j millerhouectect robert p virgohouectectcc mark e haedickehouectect richard b sandershouectect subject power systemsguys power systems has given me a proposal to replace the new albany and doyle b burners this could possibly have two benefits a elimination of the possibly tainted equipment given current patent issues they are having with ge and b apparently the newer technology significantly reduces the nox emission correlating into increased operating hoursi need two things to determine if we want to move forward a mark we need to be bullet proof on the patent or lack thereof issues on the new equipment and that it would protect us from further exposure and b mitch kevin mike and bob i need your technical and commercial opinions on the merits of this proposal ie do you as a team support this proposali believe the timing on this is rather short please get back to me at your earliest convenience i will forward a copy of the proposal to each of youregardsdelainey

nsm ::::::>>>>>> re nsm claim filing i have just spoken at length with richard smith regarding certain of the concerns raised in the email below richards main concerns were as follows as to filing of a claim for equity interests held richard indicates that this is not common practice and there may not be any provision for it in thai bankruptcy law the claims to be filed are applications for debt repayment which are intended to set forth a fixed sum of which the creditor seeks payment given the nature of equity investments they do not really fit into the governing thai bankruptcy law provisions richard is following up with his thai partner to further explore this issue and i will be speaking with both of them later today as to the contingent indemnification claims richard advises that the application for debt repayment must state a claim in a fixed amount again he is going to consult with his thai partner on this issue but his suggested approach is to file the claims as follows with respect to the pending litigation in the face amount of the claims asserted against the defendants as an approximation of the potential maximum exposure and with respect to any potential litigation in the total face amount of the bond issuances also as an approximation of potential maximum exposure two areas of greater uncertainty are any claims for legal fees andor punitive damages which obviously are not readily quantifiablei will keep you advised of our further discussions on these issues original message from eammongkolchai pichitphon

america corp wishes to claim for the shares equity as listed in the shareholders agreement held by it in nsm however having reviewed the documentation so far received by us we are unsure as to the legal grounds under which enron north america corp is entitled to claim this sum could you please clarify the nature of this claim ect thailand investment inc wishes to claim for the shares equity as listed in the securities purchase agreement held by it in nsm however as in above having reviewed the documentation received by us we are unsure as to the legal grounds under which ect thailand investment inc is entitled to claim this sum could you please clarify the nature of this claim ect securities limited partnership wishes to claim for any contingent liability that they may be subject to as a result of the litigation undertaken by farallon capital et al and legg mason income trust inc et al as discussed the sums which are allowed to be claimed have to be fixed sums as of the date on which the court granted an order to reorganise nsms business ie may it would appear to us that asides from the legal fee sums an exact sum for the contingent liabilities cannot be ascertained at this time i would therefore appreciate clarification of how this is to be determined otherwise the claim amount may have to be the full potential liabilities as claimed in the two litigation cases documentation as discussed we also require the following documentation which we understand will be faxed to us during the course of today corporate documents of the entities making claims evidence of the change in the entities name if different from the name in the relevant agreements debenture certificate either global or definitive evidence of the payment purchase price a copy of the notice of the event of default or demand letters as sent by the trustee if any the definition and rules of usage as defined in the shareholders agreement in addition we do not know whether your claims in relation to the shareholders agreement are related to certain documents as described therein eg management agreement enron purchase agreement if they are related we would require copies of such agreements as well tables setting out all amounts ie principal interest expenses etc being claimed by the claiming entities as mentioned in our discussion in order to complete the application on time

nsm ::::::>>>>>> discussion with barth lebow and vas re schultes richard earlier today i spoke with barry friedberg schultes new york counsel to get some idea of what areas schultes ohio counsel would be interested in during tomorrows discussion friedberg explained that the ohio counsel are classic plaintiffs lawyers they are not that familiar with the issues and will tend to ask broad generalized questions friedberg also noted that they may be unaware that enron is a defendant in the two california actions and will likely be unaware that enron is the only defendant who has not crosscomplained against schultes for purposes of insuring that any deposition testimony in the ohio case is not used against any defendant in the bondholders litigation friedberg thought it would be a good idea to try a limit any discussion to postclosing events and more specifically whether enron personnel were privy to any discussions with sdi or mcdonald regarding the decision to fire schultes schultes alleged dishonesty and schultes alleged incompetence friedberg explained that busses defenses to the defamation and wrongful termination claims are that he did not make any defamatory statements and if he did they were true the problem with the second defense is that it may affect our defenses in the bondholders litigation if enron or others were aware that schultes was dishonest or incompetent it will be important to know when and how they learned of such information ideally they learned it after the closing and only through discussions between mcdonald and sdithis email message may contain legally privileged andor confidential information if you are not the intended recipients or the employee or agent responsible for delivery of this message to the intended recipients you are hereby notified that any dissemination distribution or copying of this email message is strictly prohibited if you have received this message in error please immediately notify the sender and delete this email message from your computer 
nsm ::::::>>>>>> fw farallon demurrer hearing looks like natwests crosscomplaint against farallons fund managers may hold up at the pleading stage see below original message from bhalla sabina sent friday september pm to howard steve subject farallon demurrer hearing this morning i attended the hearing on crossdefendants demurrer to natwests crosscomplaint the judge permitted extensive oral argument from bruce macloed representing farallon and oaktree and jim wines representing natwest judge berle was extremely active in asking questions to each party he was primarily concerned with the relationship between the fund managers and oaktree and farallon and whether that was a fiduciary relationship and if so what level of fiduciary duty was owed he seemed inclined to leave this issue for summary judgment the crossdefendants argued that if this suit was to go forward it would create a disincentive for fund managers to report fraud since the fund managers may ultimately be personally liable judge berle asked natwest if this was more of an affirmative defense instead of a cross claim which was being used to diminish plaintiffs complaint natwest stated that the fiduciaries were liable for not investigating farallonoaktree admitted that it has imputed any negligence and actual knowledge from the fund managers to itself and that defendants are entitled to an offset interestingly plaintiffs stated that the fund managers were damaged themselves since they did not receive a bonus etc the judge seemed inclined to permit a demurrer to the contribution cause of action since natwest did not really defend that cause of action separate from the indemnity action natwest pointed to a case platt v coldwell banker cal appd which natwest claimed allows the fund managers to be sued independently a cross action is permitted if the plaintiffs could have brought the same claims against the fund managers and natwest argued that the plaintiffs could have brought such a claim finally natwest said it would be prejudiced if it could not point the finger at the highly paid investement manager according to the platt case a nonparty witness is very different than a potential indemnitor who is sitting at the table at trial the judge said his ruling would occur before oct legg mason crossdefendants have until that time to file a response to the crosscomplaint that was what the ex parte application was aboutthis email message may contain legally privileged andor confidential information if you are not the intended recipients or the employee or agent responsible for delivery of this message to the intended recipients you are hereby notified that any dissemination distribution or copying of this email message is strictly prohibited if you have received this message in error please immediately notify the sender and delete this email message from your computer

nsm ::::::>>>>>> busse depo update richard kathy finished her questions at the end of the day yesterday her approach was very helpful to enron and also painewebber even to the point of skipping pages in documents that referred to either of them enrons name was mentioned probably three or four times in three days and then only in questions not in answerskathys themes were at the time of the offering portions of the hot mill were incomplete and the hot mill was not really operating the design of the cold mill was flawed the role of sdi in the managment of nsm was greatly exaggerated in the offering presentations kathy did not seem to be be saying as other have that the role of the management co was exaggerated nucor was really sticklers first choice for sdis role but nucor pulled out becasue of substantive concerns eg flawed design of cold mill stickler lied when he told others that nucor just wanted too much money based on what i have seen so far i dont think we know yet why stickler and nucor did not make a deal by late april if not before nsm managment and directors knew that the projections in the offering materials were way off as nsms own internal budget was much different roland and i showed you these documents when we were last in houston a substantial portion of the offering funds were still in trust at this time how much and the bondholders should have been told when they could still pull back some of their money if they wanted to that the projections on which they had invesfted were not correct if this argument were developed and had legal merit it could hurt enron as its affiliates or employees were a initial purchasers in the offering b a member of the management co and c a member of the nsm board kathy was never clear in her questioning whether she regarded sdi as a defrauder or a defraudee at times she seemed to be saying that sdi knew bad things about nsm and the mill and concealed them or permitted others to lie about them at other times she seemed to be inviting busse to say that he was lied to there is no question that kathy regards david stickler as the number one bad guy and david wheeler natwest as number two busses principal themes were sdi agreed only to a very limited role all of the problems were soluble if nsm had good management nsm turned out to have terrible managment busse and everyone else were lied to about that and that is why nsm failed i had not realized before this week that by the time of the closing the management co had only members sdi and affiliates of mcdonald and enron stickler was appointed manager of the management co if enron has a problem in this case it will likely arise out of the combination of enrons two rolesie involved in the offering itself and then in the follow on management of nsm i suggest that if i cant make progress with hirschmann next week we milbank notice and take leggmasons deposition assuming that the other defendants agreeand maybe even if they dont its time to stop letting legg mason have a free ridesteve this email message may contain legally privileged andor confidential information if you are not the intended recipients or the employee or agent responsible for delivery of this message to the intended recipients you are hereby notified that any dissemination distribution or copying of this email message is strictly prohibited if you have received this message in error please immediately notify the sender and delete this email message from your computer

nsm ::::::>>>>>> busse depoday richard tom hatch robbins kaplan robin diem hirschmann and steve odonnell piper marbury asked questions today none was as aggressive as nor had the presence of kathy patrick however tom hatch is quite good and definitely to be taken seriously the other two made little impressiona lot of the questions today focused on thai graft and corruption with the suggestion that busse stickler and others implicitly enron knew that it was there and did not really do anything to try to stop ita number of questions resulted in the appearance perhaps true that the managment company never really functioned certainly not effectively the argument was not that the management company did not have enough power but rather that the management company effectively abdicated leaving everything to schultesall of this made me slightly nervous i wonder if the bondholders could argue that the members of the management company has a fiduciary duty to the bondholders during the months after the offering to exercise the power that they had to stop graft and improve operations if there were such a legal duty and there may well not have been then the facts would probably not be good for the management company membersin fact the way that the managment company llc agreement was structured all power was in the hands of a single individual managerdavid sticklerand the only power that the members had was to remove stickler which would have required unananimity between ect thailand and sdi although the managment company had a few meetings it is not clear what this means or legally who met at all as the management company had no board or governing body other than the individual managerother themes sdi was having trouble with its own dri facility and really wanted access to information about nsms dri facility everyone knew that john schultes had no minimill experience and might be corrupt and that the project would fail unless nucor or sdi agreed to run it which neither did stickler kept picturing sdi as managing nsm but sdi steadfastly declined the rolewe should finish tomorrow steve this email message may contain legally privileged andor confidential information if you are not the intended recipients or the employee or agent responsible for delivery of this message to the intended recipients you are hereby notified that any dissemination distribution or copying of this email message is strictly prohibited if you have received this message in error please immediately notify the sender and delete this email message from your computer

pacific_virgo ::::::>>>>>> in re mv pacific virgo privileged and confidential attorneyclient communication attorney work productdavid this will summarize our telephone conference of todays date i understand that you had an extensive and interesting conference with matt and neale gregson of watson farleys singapore office while you are still wading through a great deal of new information i understand your preliminary views to be as follows subject to your further review you feel comfortable with using captain richard gregory of noble dentons singapore office as one of ects experts so long as he does the work himself you are going to do some additional investigation with neale of dr eric mullen of burgoynes who would be acting as ects chemist given that his background may primarily be in fire investigation if you decide to use someone other than dr mullen please give me your recommendation as soon as possible so that we can make sure that our first team of experts is available to attend the joint surveyanalysis please also let me know as soon as you hear for when it will be scheduled you felt that our case against mitsubishi would be very dependent on the exchanges between ect and mitsubishi regarding tank cleaning along with interpretation of various charter party clauses while matt will correct me if i am wrong i believe that eric tan was ects point man on those negotiations perhaps matt could liaise with you to set up a joint telephone conference with you neale matt and eric on the line to flange down exactly what eric recalls having happened i do not know whether eric was also involved in negotiating the charter party terms but if he was that makes him an even more important witness matt may i leave this with you to set up you preliminarily felt that as neale recently suggested ect may have a case against the ultimate owners of the vessel that may not be subject to the charter party terms this is based on the applicable bl which you have not yet had a chance to review but which you were told the master signed on his own behalf rather than on behalf of mitsubishi if you recommend that ect pursue the owners then ect will need to seize the vessel and obtain a letter of undertaking from its pi club ultimately ect would then proceed with litigation probably in the jurisdiction where the seizure took place or if the parties agreed by arbitration this would be separate and apart from arbitration against mitsubishi meanwhile i authorized you to proceed with retaining a ship tracking service to locate the vessel i await your formal recommendation as to whether we should seize the ship and the particulars regarding local counsel and expected costs you will send a draft statement of ects position to matt to forward to mitsubishi to the effect that ect feels it owes mitsubishi nothing for the additional freight or demurrage given that it was all caused by contamination of the cargo onboard the ship i will ask for authority for you to send this to mitsubishi and revert as soon as i can you are reviewing the fgpcect contract and surrounding circumstances and will provide us your views in due coursemany thanks for your help regards britt davis 
pacific_virgo ::::::>>>>>> mv pacific virgo just a note on davids good email although i completely agree with item i have been advised that i need to get john nowlans authority he is the ultimate business client before we send this message to mitsubishi i am trying to meet with him tomorrow to get that authority ill keep you closely advised as to my progress bkd forwarded by britt daviscorpenron on pm jomoodyclydecouk pm to matthiasleeenroncom cc brittdavisenroncom ngregsonwfwcom subject mv pacific virgothanks for the detailed information you gave me in our lengthy telephoneconversations today and the exchange of viewsi have not finished reading all the documents yet and set out some preliminarythoughts to cover the areas we discussed expertsi have no problem with richard gregory provided he is the one who does the workas for dr mullen of burgoynes i do have some reservations he is principallyin my view a fire expert whilst acknowledging he does have chemistry knowledgei wonder if he is the right man for a technical oil chemistry job mypreferred choice is mr steve jones of apc petroleum in the uk i have used himbefore and found him clever and objective i know that john minton for whom ihave a high regard regards him well britt has said that it is important wetake the right decision here even if it means sending a uk chemist out tosingapore to attend the joint sampling mr jones therefore has myrecommendation a potential problem is that he is on holiday from todayreturning to the office on tuesday morning he is fairly available after thensince it is unlikely that the joint testing will take place this week nor thevery early part of next week perhaps this is not a problemi assume the joint testing will be proceeded by agreement between the relevantnominated experts to the test programme mr jones if he is appointed candeal with this in the uk by liaising with mr bennett of mtd whom he knows andothers i wonder if sgs should also be shown a proposed test programme and theyshould also attend the joint testingmy own thinking is that mr bennett of mtd should perhaps prepare a testprogramme but you may have already dealt with this and taken other decisions claim against time charterersi have looked at the advices priority should be given to understanding fullythe exchanges on the charterers cleaning instructions it may be worthwhiletaking a statement from enrons charterers representation who was responsiblefor giving the instructions and corresponding with owners it does seem thatenron was annoyed that the vessel did not have sufficient fresh water on boardto carry out a water rinse which enron wanted to order the vessel to carry outit seems that the vessel simply said that this was not an option because theydid not have sufficient fresh water on board leaving enron with no alternativebut to load on top with strippingdraining encouraged perhaps by owners commentthat the last cargo was cossack crude and the loading operation was load on topbasis ie no tank cleaning was performed prior to loading the cargo i thinkwe need to explore carefully these telex exchanges before coming to a final viewon the vessels responsiblity for the contamination assuming it is agreed thatthe cargo damage is attributable to the vessel and lack of cleaning a point mtdwill be closely looking at with respect to the claim under the policy thatunderwriters anticipate at the moment these telex exchanges look favourable freightdemurragea long with others i agree that we should not pay this to time charterersprobably the time has arrived where we should be sending a message along thelines that the freight for the second leg and demurrage has been occasionedsolely as a result of time charterers breach of their charter obligation putsimply cargo was delivered to them in a sound condition and discharged in acontaminated condition most probably because the tanks were not fit andsuitable for the carriage of the cargo in our message perhaps we can suggestthat further discussion on the matter should be put on hold until the outcome ofthe joint testing and the parties should be guided accordingly by the outcomein the event of any continuing disagreement the dispute will have to beresolved in arbitration personally i think it may well be difficult to resistan application for an interim award for freight since it will be argued thatfreight for the second leg was paid on existing charterparty terms that ithink provides that payment should be made without discount i think i amright in saying there was no separate charterparty entered into and we will alsohave to take a closer look at the messages with owners when the second leg wasdiscussed the claim for demurrage will be easier to resist assuming it isattributable to the contamination any demurrage that is not attributable tothe contamination should probably be paid claim against head owners under blfor reasons discussed we should explore the possibility of an arrest brittwould like wfw to ask ang partners if they are conflicted out and also howmuch it will cost to arrest including how much monies are to be advanced priorto securing an arrest ang partners are not to be instructed yet your contract with fgpcthis appears to be unrelated to the contamination in the sense that i note thecargo passed d with ashing methods used and failed on th july both withashing and plain d methods for reasons probably connected with siemensfgpc refuse to amend the contract which is obviously the sensible thing to doi assume by the way sgs are right when they say that ashing is amodification of the test method as opposed to a preparatory step or additionie are sgs right in saying that the test method has not been complied with ifashing is used it may be that the way to look at this is to focus onmitigation it is obvious that enron are boxed in and cannot find a condensatethat using this test method will generate an accurate result it is hit andmiss i have nof formed a view on how to proceed yet and am anxious to get thisemail off to you as it standsregardsdavid bestplease reply to davidbestclydecoukthis email and any

pacific_virgo ::::::>>>>>> mv pacific virgo richard heres the latest thinking on the fgpcect liquid fuel agreement conflict in brief it looks like we have an argument but it is too early to tell whether we have the better argument bkd forwarded by britt daviscorpenron on pm helengodelclydecouk pm to matthiasleeenroncom cc brittdavisenroncom ngregsonwfwcom subject mv pacific virgofrom david bestyou asked for a preliminary opinion following our telephone conference thismorning on enrons contractual remedies and exposures on the fgpc contracti am afraid the matter is complex and there is no straightforward answerfirst we should start with the contract which i have now read i am assumingthe ndc date has passed but not the conversion date article is anacknowledgment by the seller that the buyers preference is for condensatebecause of favourable tax considerations there is however an unfettered optiongiven by article to enron to deliver alternative liquid fuel in the form ofgasoil or naphtha meeting the quality specificationsthe quality specifications for liquid fuel are set out in appendix aarticle under the abbreviation t provides for a liquid fuel tax differentialwhich is a price burden falling on enron as part of the price formulationhowever in the event seller is unable to deliver condensate using reasonablecommercial efforts but supplies another type of liquid fuel instead t shall bedeemed to be zero for the first barrels in the aggregate of such othertypes of liquid fuel delivered in a contract yearother relevant articles are buyers right to secure alternative suppliesthe whole of article sellers default the whole of article determination of quantity and quality mitigation of losses anda buyer shall be under no obligation to accept delivery of any quantityof liquid fuel which fails to meet the quality specifications no doubt there are other relevant articles but the above seem the importantones to methe facts have been summarised already in numerous emails and correspondenceand i certainly will not repeat them except to say that i think it is correctthat it is simply not possible to buy condensate applying test method d forcondensate for this reason for example your contract with phillips brothersfor the pacific virgo did not include this test method sgs consider d is wholly inappropriate for condensate and have saidthat modifying d with ashing is the preferred method to achieve higherreproduceability indeed the previous two cargoes of condensate supplied tofgpc have been tested using ashing the gasoil has been nominated for august to replace the contaminated elangarguably because of the lack of lead time to find suitable cargo of condensatebut more probably because the trader in question understandably is concernedthat a substitute condensate cargo may fail if the plain d test method isused fgcp have said in a recent email dated th july that fgcp will nothesitate to reject any cargo which fails to meet the guaranteed specificationand which offers any possibility of invalidating any guarantees or warrantiesgiven by siemens they are therefore not prepared to entertain any amendmentto the contractfollowing our telephone conference and having read the contract i saw problemsfor enron and decided to share my thoughts with john lockey of essex courtchambers he is the barrister specialising in such problems often used by meand the firm for second opinions and obviously helpful on a case such as thiswe debated the subject at length and came to the following tentative conclusionswhich i shall put in bullet form he and i are available for discussion at am tomorrow at my office and i propose to call you at that time to hearyour comments and to deal with any questions you may have on the following we think that it is not possible for enron to argue with any realisticprospect of success that the apparent impossibility of finding a seller who iswilling to sell condensate applying test method d satisfies the test ofusing reasonable commercial efforts to justify zero tax for the first barrels of other types of liquid fuel in any contract year it seems to us thatthis provision is designed to deal with problems of obtaining condensate cargoesdue to force majeure related reasons after the contract has been entered intoand is not designed to provide effectively a letout because the contract simplycannot be complied with at all from its start fgpc will simply argue with someprospect of success that they entered into the contract and agreed its termsregarding pricing etc on the basis that enron was able to supply condensateapplying d this squares with what they have said in their recent emailwhich i have quoted above the same email goes on to saythe allowance for barrels was built into the lfpc to act as a safetyvalve only to be used should circumstances demand it if we are right about what we say above this means that enron are in theinvidious position of having to source condensate to avoid the tax notknowing whether it is going to meet d if sgs test using d and fail thecargo the contract supposedly gives fgpc an entitlement to reject their covercosts could include gasoil with its additional tax as a cost since there is noavailable condensate for sale on the market applying d assuming we areright about this assumption in above it occurs to us that it may be possible to argue with some merit thatappendix b has to be construed to imply a term that d only applies tocondensate if it is truly applicable to that grade you will note that appendixb sets out a test method in one column and three grades gasoil naphtha andcondensate in other columns if sgs are right that the test method isinappropriate they should not be testing against d for condensate puttingit another way the condensate could be on spec applying the appropriateashing method and the test method set out in appendix b will not necessarilydetermine this as you say it is hit and miss objectively the intention ofthe parties must be to apply the appropriate test method or not to apply a testmethod if it is not capable of determining the contractual specificationapplying this reasoning it means that enron are not in breach by supplying acargo of condensate in circumstances where the d test is simply not carriedout because contractually it cannot apply as we say above we think sgs should not be carrying out this test at all ifit is entirely inappropriate indeed sgs who are jointly appointed should beinstructed by enron not to carry out the test there is some force for this inarticle a which says that measurement of quantities and taking of samplesfor the purposes of determining the quality of liquid fuel in each shipmentshould be carried out in accordance with international standard practice at thetime of the shipment in question it is not completely on point since theclause does not deal specifically with testing in the event that sgs confirmit is inappropriate to carry out the test and they simply do not test the buyerwill be left without any test certificate that shows the cargo has failed tomeet the quality specifications should subsequently the buyer test on his ownunder d and it fails whilst sgs independently apply the ashing method andit passes we believe the buyers will be in difficulties in maintaining a lawfulrejection before this angle is pursued we think sgs should be contacted to confirmthe test method is inappropriate we also think it is important that you and wehave sight of the exact wording of the test method to see whether on its face itis inappropriate for condensate this would help to reinforce the contentionthat it is inapplicable to condensate in appendix b finally i should like to have sight of the appendix typical laboratorycondensate analyses that is attached to the fuel supply plan that you faxedyesterdaywe look forward to speaking to you at am tomorrowregardsdavid bestplease reply to

pacific_virgo ::::::>>>>>> mv pacific virgo alan and richard fyi re the fgpcect contract john lockey is a barrister an actual trial advocate that david asked to help him given the urgency and complexity of this dispute deborah please print out and file bkd forwarded by britt daviscorpenron on am juliebertschinclydecouk am to matthiasleeenroncom cc brittdavisenroncom ngregsonwfwcom subject mv pacific virgofrom david bestfollowing our telephone conference this morning the following advice can begiven please treat this advice as the joint advice of myself and counsel johnlockey we give it in bullet form for the purposes of clarity the terms of the astm d do support the view that it is inappropriate toapply d to condensate the fact remains however that the contract definesthe contractual specification by reference to d on the face of it enronhas promised a specification in accordance with test method d and has agreedto assume the risk tht the condensate does not satisfy the specification whentested in accordance with d the terms of appendix to the fuel supply plan seem to us to make itmuch more difficult to argue that the reference in appendix b of the contract fod means only that d applies to condensate to the extent that it isappropriate to use d for condensate the fact that enron reported testresults for condensate in appendix to the fuel supply plan by referencesimply to test method d makes it very difficult to argue that when theparties concluded the contract they would have had in mind that d appliesonly to gasoil and would not apply or would only apply with modifications tocondensate the terms of the fuel supply planand of appendix make it even moredifficult to argue that the impossibility of finding a seller who is willing tosell condensate applying test method d satisfies the test of usingreasonable commercial efforts even though enron is not contractually committedto the terms of the fuel supply contract the fact is that enron put forwardtypical specifications for condensate by reference to d the fuel supplyplan reemphasises the importance to the buyer of being provided with condensatein preference to naptha or gasoil our understanding of sgs advice to enron is that d does not envisageashing and that it would be wrong to report a result by reference to testmethod d if the sample had been ashed before testing should sgs provide a test certificate certifying a specification which isoutside contractual specification applying dwith a notation that condensatefalls outside the scope of d as they suggest the buyers will still beable to reject because any verification is final conclusive and binding on theparties provided there is no manifest error if it is the case that applying d without any modifications to theastm methodology to portions of the sample condensate provided to theindependent inspector would or may well produce different results in ppm forthe same sample because of the volatility of condensate it seems to us to bestrongly arguable that the independent inspector aware that his certificationof noncompliance will be binding under the contract should simply refuse tocertify a test result by reference to d it seems to us to be difficult inthose circumstances for the inspector to conclude that a particular test resultis reliable furthermore if it is the case that it is not practicallypossible to certify quantities of elements below ppm using d oncondensate then again the independent inspector should refuse to certify atthose levels if the independent inspector refuses to certify by reference to d thebuyer will have to decide whether to reject and take his chances ofdemonstrating that in fact the condensate was offspec by reference to dthe absence of a certificate of compliance with specification does not seem tous to justify rejection if the buyer decides to reject an arbitrator wouldhave to decide on all the evidence whether the cargo was offspec as measured byd the buyer would be running the risk that he could not justify therejection with a potential exposure to enrons costs it would be prudent inthose circumstances for enron to have commissioned a number of tests using dmethodology in order to present an average and hopefully onspec result tocounteract the test results produced by the buyer it would also be prudent inthose circumstances for enron to have commissioned a number of tests using sgspreferred method of testing condensate as these results could be used by enronto require the buyer to take a rejected cargo in mitigation of the buyers lossor to submit to the arbitrators that the buyer should have mitigated byaccepting retender of the rejected cargo when accompanied by an independentinspectors certification that the specs were met by reference to the much moreappropriate methods for testing contractually it is almost certainly not open to enron to refuse to agreeon the appointment of an independent inspector or to insist that theindependent inspector should not test the sample of condensate using methodd unless there are modifications to that method when applied to condensatehowever there does not appear to be any objection to enron advising in advancethat because the independent inspectors certificate is intended to be bindingunder the contract the independent inspector should not provide a result byreference to d unless satisfied that that result is truly representative ofthe qualities of the sample turning to enrons exposure to a tax liability on the nomination andshipment of gasoil we repeat our advice given in our e mail of nd august thatit is not possible for enron to argue with any realistic prospect of successthat the apparent impossibility of finding a seller who is willing to sellcondensate applying test method d satisfies the test of using reasonablecommercial efforts to justify zero tax it seems to us that this provision isdesigned to deal with problems of obtaining condensate cargoes due to forcemajeure related reasons after the contract has been entered into the onus ison enron to demonstrate that it has used reasonable commercial efforts it islikely in our view that fgcp will set off against price a sum equivalent to thetax liability so that enron is out of pocket with the regard to the nominatedgasoil unless enron wishes to manage the contract by risking a rejection disputeeach time condensate is delivered assuming sgs do not certify enron may wanttry to renegotiate the contract it may be that the point we have raised in concerning the risk of an unlawful rejection by the buyer may be helpful in anysuch renegotiationregardsdavid bestplease reply to davidbestclydecoukthis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and

tested using both astm d without ashing and astm d with ashing at all the relevant points and whether the test results were consistent eg whether the product was onspec for both methods immediately before loading but offspec for both methods at discharge in thailand and the phillipines may i impose on you to provide one summary chronology of the analysis done at loadport and both discharge ports with particular emphasis on a whether both testing methods astm d without ashing and with ashing were used and the results and b the results for filterable dirt you have just sent something like this for the thailand cargo only which i found very helpful also if sgs or anyone else has made comment about the reliability or unreliability of the filterable dirt analysis or any other aspect of the

and myself in regard to the d issue whilst i am to look to britts guidance for the contamination on the elang cargo my apologies therefore for mixing the issues for the puposes of this email the joint testing of samples of the elang cargo is planned to take place end next week the joint testing would include metals as well as filterable dirt so we would need to decide in quite short order on the test method we want to propose for metals for relevant parties to agreealthough we believe the contamination would be dramatically demonstrated by the level of filterable dirt the metals clearly would also be an important factor as you may be aware the loadport sample results which we are presently relying on to say that the cargo was on spec when loaded was tested with ashing for metals we would not be able to say whether another loadport sample would test on spec for metals using straight d if it doesnt test on spec at the joint testing using straight d the vessel owners would surely argue that the cargo would have been rejected by first gas anyway independent of the filterable dirt although such as argument may not defeat our case entirely it is very likely to impact on the quantum we would be able to recoverit seems that the preferred test method for metals at the joint testing would therefore be ashing to avoid conflict with existing loadport sample results we still have sgss support for that but we need to convince minton treharne who acts for the cargo underwriters as well as the ownerspi club still just in case details of our dispute with mitsubishi become known to firts gas we may wish to avoid proposing a test method for joint testing that would be inconsistent with the one we ultimately present to first gas which for obvious long term objectives ought to be the correct test method acceptable to parties whether d or ashing or some other method that said i think if we are able to go with ashing for the joint testing it is not likely to jeopardize our position with first gas i note janices preference for us experts over european experts for the d issue have we been able to get any us experts view on the right test to use whether d or ashing has

the views of jim studdert and david best given that we already put underwriters on notice that there was contamination and given that we have worked closely with mintons underwriters representatives i would assume that we are under no time pressure to give underwriters a total quantum before the joint survey takes place in fact it looks like the final determination of ects total quantum of damages may be impacted by the results of the joint survey although i would not necessarily want to say that to underwriters at this point my preliminary review of the policy reflects no language in the policy which would require ect to immediately provide a total quantum the policy specifically requires under instructions in case of loss that ect file a claim in writing against the delivering carrier holding him responsible as soon as loss or damage is discovered even though the full exent thereof is not apparent details can be furnished later such action will not prejudice your insurance

residue astm dcarbon residue bottoms astm dash astm dbsw astm dv na k ca pb astm dfilterable dirt astm dplease note that for filterable dirt astm d is not applicable as itis designed for insitu line samples astm d is a laboratory methodthatis essentially equivalent both methods are intended for particulates inaviation fuels anyway sgs singapore can run astm dthe above suite of tests should be run on all selected samples it willalmost certainly not be necessary to test all available samples induplicate duplicates are necessary because standalone results arealwaysopen to doubt in any event duplicates are often a requirement of the testmethod and any reputable laboratory will run duplicates as a matter ofcourse duplicate samples should not mean twice the price investigative testingthis is more difficult to predict in terms of exactly what will benecessary to a degree it will be guided by what is found in the abovespec testing my initial recommendation would be to check the solubilityof the particulates particularly in aromatic solvent to check if organicand possibly in acid to check if inorganicif as has so far been reported the particulates are not aromatic solventsoluble and because they do not appear to contribute to the ash content ofthe fuel a best guess might be that they are carbon particles howeverwe need to keep an open mind on thiswe might need to think about microscopy visible or electron on theparticles possibly also look at elemental analysis of the particles byegenergy dispersive xray analysisi will give some further thought to what might be required by way ofinvestigative analysis and revert at this stage i suggest that alloptionson the investigative side are kept open ownerspi might not agree butrealistically we cannot predict what we will find or what might need to bedone until we start getting some spec test results and some simpleparticlesolubilities donei trust this helps please keep me advised regarding samplesjoint

pacific_virgo ::::::>>>>>> re din re mv pacific virgo privileged and confidential attorneyclient communication attorney work productmatti agree w britt that we need to know more about what testing has been done but i would think that the joint test should be conducted using the same method used at loadport regardless of whether ashing is proper or not not for the reason you mention mitsubishi may well argue about proper rejection but thats not likely a viable argument since the fact is that first gas rejected the cargo and the dirt spec alone was sufficient grounds for that rejection but for the sake of consistency it doesnt matter at all to first gas what test methods were used or will be used on this cargo its no longer any of their concern its enrons risk and sole responsibility to

joint testing of samples of the elang cargo is planned to take place end next week the joint testing would include metals as well as filterable dirt so we would need to decide in quite short order on the test method we want to propose for metals for relevant parties to agreealthough we believe the contamination would be dramatically demonstrated by the level of filterable dirt the metals clearly would also be an important factor as you may be aware the loadport sample results which we are presently relying on to say that the cargo was on spec when loaded was tested with ashing for metals we would not be able to say whether another loadport sample would test on spec for metals using straight d if it doesnt test on spec at the joint testing using straight d the vessel owners would surely argue that the cargo would have been rejected by first gas anyway independent of the filterable dirt although such as argument may not defeat our case entirely it is very likely to impact on the quantum we would be able to recoverit seems that the preferred test method for metals at the joint testing would therefore be ashing to avoid conflict with existing loadport sample results we still have sgss support for that but we need to convince minton treharne who acts for the cargo underwriters as well as the ownerspi club still just in case details of our dispute with mitsubishi become

pacific_virgo ::::::>>>>>> re din re mv pacific virgo privileged and confidential attorneyclient communication attorney work productmatt im on the same page as janice with regard to testing although id like to spin out my thoughts a bit in my view at the end of the day it is virtually inevitable that both d with ashing and d without ashing are going to be used on the critical loadport sample and therefore for the rest of the samples as well at the joint analysis mitsubishis strategy at the joint analysis will be to get the remaining loadport sample to come up offspec on retesting for obvious reasons prior to the joint analysis mitsubishi will be aware that a d without ashing is in the fgh contract and that b ect believes d without ashing may have a reproducibility issue with this type of product given this if ect proposes to use only d with ashing our safest bet on the loadport sample at the joint analysis mitsubishi will smell a rat and insist on d without ashing the same would apply i think if even if ect proposed to use only d without ashing as its sole test at the joint analysis the more different kinds of tests mitsubishi can forcefully argue should be run the more likely it is that one of them will show the loadport sample is offspec mitsubishis goal will be supported by the general practice of the chemists involved who will want to rerun every test previously run in order to get to the bottom of this my sense is that it would be very difficult under the circumstances for ect to credibly take the position that only one test or the other d with ashing or d without ashing should be run in fact in light of what i believe is virtually inevitable mitsubishi insisting on whatever test we dont propose and in order to keep from appearing to be overly concerned about the reproducibility problem my feeling is that we may want to go ahead and propose both tests to mitsubishi assuming that it is expected that we would initially propose the proper tests to mitsubishi and not the other way around can you let us know exactly who will be doing the handson testing of this product in singapore i know that we nominated sgs singapore but does this necessarily mean that someone from sgs will be doing the actual work as opposed to us just using sgss lab as janice pointed out we need to make absolutely sure that a the lab is firstclass and b whoever performs the test this time is very experienced with d with and without ashing also it is my thought that we do not want anyone from sgs there who is aware of the presale analysis that sgs did of the elang crude cargo this latter point especially needs to be handled with great care if there is a need to communicate with sgs about any of this i would suggest that you first confer with david or nealmany thanks for

we are presently relying on to say that the cargo was on spec when loaded was tested with ashing for metals we would not be able to say whether another loadport sample would test on spec for metals using straight d if it doesnt test on spec at the joint testing using straight d the vessel owners would surely argue that the cargo would have been rejected by first gas anyway independent of the filterable dirt although such as argument may not defeat our case entirely it is very likely to impact on the quantum we would be able to recoverit seems that the preferred test method for metals at the joint testing would therefore be ashing to avoid conflict with existing loadport sample results we still have sgss support for that but we need to convince minton treharne who acts for the cargo underwriters as well as the ownerspi club still just in case details of our dispute with mitsubishi become known to firts gas we may wish to avoid proposing a test method for joint testing that would be inconsistent with the one we ultimately present to first gas which for obvious long term objectives ought to be the correct test method acceptable to parties whether d or ashing or some other method that said i think if we are able to go with ashing for the joint testing it is not likely to jeopardize our position with first gas i note janices preference for us experts over european experts for the d issue have we been able to get any us experts view on the right test to use whether d or ashing has enron formed a view on the correct test method if we have been able to source a friendly us expert we may want to have his input for the contamination issue your views and guidance would be most appreciatedthanks and regardsmatti also note janices preference to source for us experts to assist us on the d issue over european experts and was wondering whether we have been able to for

pacific_virgo ::::::>>>>>> in re mv pacific virgo privileged and confidential attorneyclient communication attorney work productheres an update matt if any of this appears inaccurate to you dont hesitate to point it out the pending joint survey a the joint survey has yet to be scheduled the reason for the delay is an issue concerning whether sgss singapore laboratory has the resourcescompetence to carry out the joint analysis steve jones ects choice of chemist is communicating with sgs in order to make this determination although this has delayed scheduling the joint testing jones feels strongly that it will be most costeffective for ect to proceed with a joint analysis only after making this determination i and matt have personally spoken with jones about this and believe he understands that ect is looking for the quickest most costeffective resolution to this dispute with mitsubishi because of the issue with sgs jones has waited until now to send the proposed testing program to technichem mitsubishis choice of surveyorchemist in a previous report i mentioned that the testing program had already been sent to technichem this now turns out not to be the case by today jones should have sent the proposed testing program to technichem in order to get the ball rolling and with the expectation that technichem will have comments that will require time to incorporate b if things go well with sgs jones anticipates scheduling a joint analysis about twothree weeks from now jones plan to personally attend the joint survey on our behalf given the complexity of the testing methods even after that testing jones anticipates the possibility of further testing in england using highly specialized equipment to determine whether the apparent filterable dirt buildup was caused by a malfunction of the vessels inert gas system costs a surveyorschemists jones advises that to date he and his firm have spent a total of about days at pounds per day for a total of approximately pounds or roughly at the current usdpounds exchange rate of pound jones has subcontracted some of his work to allen goddard now with itscaleb brett who specializes in the type of testing at issue jones estimates that goddard has spent approximately one day on this matter at a daily rate of lbs or jones estimates that from this point until the actual joint survey begins he will spend about two more days and goddard will spend about another onehalf day this totals about pounds or for the actual joint testing jones estimates that he will spend about twelve days straight including transit time goddard would not attend but would be available by telephone if jones had a question twelve days time amounts to pounds or not including aire fare room and board afterwards for the additional testing in england to determine whether the inert gas system caused the buildup in filterable dirt jones estimates another pounds for the cost of the lab he does not know at this point whether he would attend the entire testing procedure which he believes could be completed in about two days if he attended both days this additional testing in england would run to another pounds or b other experts sgs and caleb bretts costs to date are being compiled by matt sgs will spend another sgd purchasing the necessary chemicals for the joint testing and bill for another sgd for prejointanalysis development work basically practicing on extra samples from the pacific virgo this comes to a total of sgd or about to prepare for the joint analysis based on the current reported sgdusd exchange rate of sgs estimates that it will bill us for the joint analysis sgd or about captain sawant of pacmarine one of our ship operations experts will be charging us sgd or about for work done to date which should be largely concluded with the finalization of his report captain gregory of noble denton the ship operation expert we would probably use for testifying has been asked to do no work on this matter at this time c attorneys david best is out of town on vacation but his office advises that his time and expenses to date amounts to approximately pounds or about this is subject to being adjusted up or down once best gets back in the office and has time to review the bill i imagine that this bill does not include the time incurred by a barrister that best called for advice on the fgh issue neither best nor anyone from his firm will need to attend the joint testing neale gregsons firm watson farley has incurred fees and expense to date of sgd or about matt has not yet seen an itemized bill for this time but feels that while it is high it is not unexpected given the timeintensive nature of this matter matt will be asking gregson whether the time also includes time spent on the fgh matter my and my legal assistants fee and expenses through today amount to approximately this also includes time spent on the fgh matter although pursuant to alans instructions i am no longer spending time on that matter except where necessary to keep janice moore apprised d summary of costs in sum no less than approximately has been spent to date and this figure will increase once i get the sgs and caleb brett costs to date and once david best comes back from vacation on september and reviews his bill although these figures probably include a heavy overlap of time spent on the fgh matter another will be necessary to get ready for the joint analysis another to perform the joint analysis in singapore and another approximately to perform specialized testing in london after the joint analysis is done if steve jones determines that such further testing is necessary recent sale of thailand cargo a you will recall that the bulk of the product from the mv pacific virgo was discharged in to shore tanks in thailand and has not been tendered to fgh given the problems with the product discharged later in the phillipines which was tendered to fgh who rejected it samples from the shore tanks in thailand have recently been tested by sgss laboratory in the us and reportedly found on spec all of the thailand product has recently been sold to caltex singapore for delivery september reportedly for use in caltexs refinery which makes the risk of rejection of that product by caltex very low b unfortunately matt advises that the trader cannot give us even a ballpark figure for the sales price of the thailand product until the end of the month given that the price is tied to some market index lacking this it is difficult to estimate what total diminution in market value of the elang crude ect has sustained until then we were previously told that the product discharged in singapore sustained a diminution in market value of about for my own purposes based on nothing more than speculation and given that the bulk of the cargo was discharged in thailand i am using the working hypothesis that ects total damages for diminution of market value of all the product discharged from the mv pacific virgo is in the range of again this may later turn out to be very inaccurate expert witness supplemental opinion at my request captain sawant our consulting expert on ship operations was asked whether he believed that ects instructions to the ship regarding tank washing would have been sufficient to prevent the type of contamination that occurred had such instructions been properly carried out ie if the ship had access to fresh water captain sawant has opined that he does not believe such instructions were sufficient to have prevented the type of contamination that occurred while we can protect captain sawants opinion from discovery by using him only as a consulting expert it strikes me that mitsubishi will likely not overlook this issue despite this however ect still has some argument that the carriage of goods by sea act puts a nondelegable duty to provide a cargoworthy ship on mitsubishi

pacific virgo privileged and confidential attorneyclient communication attorney work product matt it was a pleasure speaking with you this evening your time as i mentioned i have some followup fact questions that i would appreciate your help with when you have a moment some of these questions probably require the attention of experts eg s and so feel free to decline to answer where the question appears outside your jurisdiction please do not call anyone outside of enron to get answers at this point also to the extent that you need to ask enron employees for answers i would prefer your asking them questions and writing down the answers to be kept in your investigation file rather sending them this email and getting email responses a chronology sent by you as an attachment to your letter of july to mike robison reflects that on november a sample of elang condensate was taken by sgs redwood singapore apparently the filterable dirt was off spec versus a max of with regard to this sampling a did enron request it yes if so who requested it john chismareric tanand for what purposepreliminary assessment of suitability of elang condensate before purchase b was the sample taken from one of the shore tanks from which the cargo at issue was loaded if not from what location was the sample obtained sample was taken from a floating facility not shoretank unclear whether from same tank as loaded cargo loaded cargo likely to have come from a few tanks c did the testing reveal that anything else that has us concerned about the present cargo such as the presence of metals no d did enron do any followup with phillips who i understand was the supplier about the offspec dirt or anything else that was discovered during the sampling if so please give the particulars as to who was involved what was said and what the result was not sure if john chismar spoke with phillips but note that cargo was not bought with guaranteed fgh type specs but normal export quality at the time and place of loading e has the sample been retained november sample all used up at testing did enron discuss with the supplier athe proposed end use of this product b its fitness for that end use andor c the contract specs that enron had to meet to satisfy fgh if not why not john chismars input required another chronology prepared by you mentions that a loadport analysis was performed by sgs on june and that our cargo met the fgh contract specs i assume in all regards yes ashing method used do we still have that sample available for retesting and will a restest of it be included in the current round of testing the samples were drawn at loadport from an autosampler xl samples were used up at the june test we presently have a xl loadport sample from the autosampler in singapore reserved for joint testing and analysis in singapore there is also another xl loadport sample from the autosampler in ownerspi club possession which we have asked to be surrendered to us to be delivered to singapore where all samples are being collated for joint testing and analysis why is this product called elang crude when it is in reality reportedly condensate cargo called crude by supplier apparently because of export reasons have to check with john chismar understand from speaking with pacmarine that an ultralight crude like elang can generally be referred to as condensate but there is no real benchmark as to how light a crude must be before it can rightly be regarded as condensate what is the meaning of the term export grade are there various other gradations if so what do those mean john chismars input required has enron ever purchased elang crude from this supplier previously no ever heard of any prior problems with elang crude from this supplier no note that condensate is typically delivered to refineries not power plants that are not too concerned with detailed specs has enron ever chartered the pacific virgo in the past to transport elang crude noif so please give a thumbnail description of the voyages if not have we ever chartered the pacific virgo at allno prior to this voyage have our operations folks ever chartered any vessel to transport a cargo of elang crudeno however we made deliveries of senipah condensate from indonesia one in feb and another in may under the fgh contract if so please give a thumbnail description of the voyages including a whether the tanks were butterworthed senipah cargo not butterworthed but instructions were given to tank clean primarily because last cargoes were carbon black feedstock may and fueloil feb tank cleaning instructions included washing and flushing tanks pipes and pumps and if so whether enron had to pay extra we did not have to pay extra on both occasions it is only in the cp of pacific virgo that we agreed to bear costs for cleaning b whether the end use of the elang crude was similar to the end use of the cargo here both senipah condensate cargoes were for fgh and c whether there were any contamination problemsconcerns no note however that ashing method was used by sgs on both feb and may senipah cargoes who were the enron ops personnel who negotiated the butterrworth issue with the owners eric tan if there are written documents memorializing this including letters telexes telefaxes emails taped or recorded telephone messages calendar entries or diary entries they need to be preserved i wonder if i could put you in charge of making sure that all files relevant to this voyage generally are carefully preserved for possible use as evidence later on one thing we dont want to happen is to face a spurious charge of spoliation of evidence because an allegedly important document or memo from our files is inadvertantly lost or destroyed the watson farley letter opinion of july notes that the bl identified the actual owners as the carriers rather than mitsubishi who i understand was probably a timecharterer the broker has confirmed mitsubishi corp to be the time charterer the copies of the bl that i have seen however reflect a blank space in the form underneath the word carrier do you have access to a bl that mentions the name of the actual owner no perhaps watson farley meant that because barwil agencies signed on behalf of the master that the true owner was bound although i am just guessing my understanding is the same the pacmarine report dated july ascribes the cause of the contamination to a accumulation of excessive sediments in the ships cargo tanks especially clinkage and b the cleansing properties of condensate although the author refrains from squarely linking the excessive sediments to prior inadequate tank cleaning he clearly leans in that direction on the other hand it is not clear from the report whether adequate tank cleaning under the circumstances required butterworthing i spoke with pacmarine capt sawant his opinion is that butterworthing or using the vessels on board equipment to rinse and flush tanks pipes and pumps with freshwater would have been adequate cleaning a were our ops people aware of the prior cargoes we were aware of the last cargoesand the methods used to clean the tanks we were aware that no tank cleaning was done prior to loading the last cargo andor the cleansing property of condensates yes but the assumption made was the previous cargo of cossack crude with similar properties would have cleaned the tank and the vessel being young would not have a lot of clinkage i get the impression from your issue for consideration that the answer to the prior cargoes part of this question is yes b was it within the scope of sgss duties to advise enron of the foregoing no i would need expert support on whether it is owner or charterers duty to know suitable tank cleaning method or were they only supposed to issue a dry certificate c did we have anyone else attend the ship at loading on our behalf besides sgs no i know this covers a lot of information none of it is urgent next week will be fine for a response many thanks for your help bkd

or about for work done to date which should be largely concluded with the finalization of his report captain gregory of noble denton the ship operation expert we would probably use for testifying has been asked to do no work on this matter at this time c attorneys david best is out of town on vacation but his office advises that his time and expenses to date amounts to approximately pounds or about this is subject to being adjusted up or down once best gets back in the office and has time to review the bill i imagine that this bill does not include the time incurred by a barrister that best called for advice on the fgh issue neither best nor anyone from his firm will need to attend the joint testing neale gregsons firm watson farley has incurred fees and expense to date of sgd or about matt has not yet seen an itemized bill for this time but feels that while it is high it is not unexpected given the timeintensive nature of this matter matt will be asking gregson whether the time also includes time spent on the fgh matter my and my legal assistants fee and expenses through today amount to approximately this also includes time spent on the fgh matter although pursuant to alans instructions i am no longer spending time on that matter except where necessary to keep janice moore apprised d summary of costs in sum no less than approximately has been spent to date and this figure will increase once i get the sgs and caleb brett costs to date and once david best comes back from vacation on september and reviews his bill although these figures probably include a heavy overlap of time spent on the fgh matter another will be necessary to get ready for the joint analysis another to perform the joint analysis in singapore and another approximately to perform specialized testing in london after the joint analysis is done if steve jones determines that such further testing is necessary recent sale of thailand cargo a you will recall that the bulk of the product from the mv pacific virgo was discharged in to shore tanks in thailand and has not been tendered to fgh given the problems with the product discharged later in the phillipines which was tendered to fgh who rejected it samples from the shore tanks in thailand have recently been tested by sgss laboratory in the us and reportedly found on spec all of the thailand product has recently been sold to caltex singapore for delivery september reportedly for use in caltexs refinery which makes the risk of rejection of that product by caltex very low b unfortunately matt advises that the trader cannot give us even a ballpark figure for the sales price of the thailand product until the end of the month given that the price is tied to some market index lacking this it is difficult to estimate what total diminution in market value of the elang crude ect has sustained until then we were previously told that the product discharged in singapore sustained a diminution in market value of about for my own purposes based on nothing more than speculation and given that the bulk of the cargo was discharged in thailand i am using the working hypothesis that ects total damages for diminution of market value of all the product discharged from the mv pacific virgo is in the range of again this may later turn out to be very inaccurate expert witness supplemental opinion at my request captain sawant our consulting expert on ship operations was asked whether he believed that ects instructions to the ship regarding tank washing would have been sufficient to prevent the type of contamination that occurred had such instructions been properly carried out ie if the ship had access to fresh water captain sawant has opined that he does not believe such instructions were sufficient to have prevented the type of contamination that occurred while we can protect captain sawants opinion from discovery by using him only as a consulting expert it strikes me that mitsubishi will likely not overlook this issue despite this however ect still has some argument that the carriage of goods by sea act puts a nondelegable duty to provide a cargoworthy ship on mitsubishi 
pacific_virgo ::::::>>>>>> in re mv pacific virgo matt advised me today that john nowlan and john chismar have decided that they want to try to settle this case before the joint survey takes place and that they will likely appoint paul henking their new head chartering person in singapore formerly of enrons houston office to contact mitsubishi about thisa a number of new developments may have influenced this decision although i would rely on matts knowledge about this as he actually spoke with nowlan and chismar sgss singapore lab continues to struggle with trying to implement the joint survey test program that steve jones our chemist wants to use in order to determine if sgs is up to it jones feels that it will be necessary to send alan goddard another one of our experts to sgss singapore lab and assist in the trials at an additional cost of about goodard cant leave for another ten days or so causing further delay goodard may or may not conclude at the end of his stay that sgs is up to it ects other options are clearly second choices in terms of cost and strategy ects damages now appear to be harder to prove as to the elang crude cargo at issue ect was recently able to calculate that it actually reportedly made over more than if ect had sold the cargo to fgh ects big loss was having to substitute a naptha cargo for the elang crude that fgh had rejected that loss is reportedly in the range of about however this seems to raise a number of issuesa is this a recoverable consequential damage i havent yet looked at the charter to see if there is any contractual limitation on damagesb can we prove that we in fact had to substitute naptha for condensate our contract with fgh reportedly requires us to sell the naptha at a big discount our traders would reportedly have a tough time stating under oath that there was no condensate available our key problem was lack of confidence what the d test would show even with condensate that we thought was on spec ect has determined that it may need to recharter vessels from mitsubishi in the future for strategic routesthere may be other reasons for nowland and chismars decision and i invite matt to report on anything else of which he is awareb settlement strategy matt advises that nowlan and chismar want to offer to settle for a net payment of by mitsubishi to us matt i would appreciate your helping me out with the numbers on how that figure was calculated i have told matt in the past that i believe a drop hands agreement between ect and mitsubishi would be a very good result and i think he and i agree david best also agreed with a drop hands agreement when i mentioned it to him in the past although he will not be aware until receipt of this email of the recent revelation regarding the damages figuresi will keep you advisedbritt

pacific_virgo ::::::>>>>>> in re mv pacific virgo gentlemen i have spoken with david best about the difficulty paul henking has encountered so far with getting any agreement from mitsubishi to delay both the joint surveytesting and arbitration in hopes of a settlement as i understand pauls suggestion paul wants to switch fronts and press our cargo underwriters to pay us off and handle the arbitration themselves paul if i have misstated your strategy please let me know i understand from pauls email that he does not think mitsubishi will settle prior to arbitration and joint testingunfortunately while we want to consider all options neither david nor i think that this approach will succeed we believe that our cargo underwriters response to our claim will be that they too want us to proceed with the joint testing before they will consider paying anything on this claim we should also all recall that ect performed a presale survey of product from the same location that was offspec although we do not think that either mitsubishi or the cargo underwriters are yet aware of that survey such a survey would seem to raise an inherent vice issue in both proceedings last until at least the joint testing has been done i think that the cargo underwriters would require us to act as a prudent uninsured ie to name an arbitrator and vigorously litigate our claimsof particular note steve jones our expert chemist has notified us that the samples taken for joint testing have a shelflife that may be coming to an end in the near future if the samples begin to turn before the joint testing has taken place the delay of the testing could be used against us in the arbitration parenthetically it also appears that a representative of the shipowners pi club wants to be involved in the testing it may be that mitsubishi as the vessels charterer has placed the head owner on notice of our claim against mitsubishi and of mitsubishis potential claim for indemnification against the head ownerunder the circumstances david and i agree that we should get the joint testing scheduled and done as soon as possible david and i have also spoken about pauls idea of advancing payment to mitsubishi for the freight claim of and agreeing to revert to mitsubishi regarding the demurrage claim by the end of november i assume that paul means that we would in fact pay what we believe we owed on the demurrage claim at or near that time and that all these amounts would be paid on a without prejudice basis ie that ect could later pursue recovery of those amounts in arbitration against mitsubishithe obvious downside of payment is that we lose our best potential leverage for bringing mitsubishi to the bargaining table but mitsubishi has resisted that leverage so far we are very exposed to advance payment of freight and demurrage subject to our later right of counterclaim if we can successfully assert that the ship was at fault by paying now we can avoid the attorneys fees and hopefully some or all of the interest that would go with an interim award to mitsubishi i have not been advised of any anticipated problem with getting mitsubishi to fund a substantial arbitration award should ect be successful in proving its contamination claim and recouping the freight and demurrage paid under these difficult circumstances both david and i agree with pauls suggestion that we pay the freight and demurrage up front without prejudice but only after we have informally discussed this on a solictortosolicitor basis so that there is no misunderstanding of ects intent to pursue the contamination claim and after a tribunal has been agreed to and any other concessions extracted that we can think of this will prevent mitsubishi from dragging its feet after we make this payment david and i have spoken about the choice of arbitrators for this singlearbitrator proceeding he and neale agree that using a qc would give us the best shot at a wellthoughtthrough legal opinion and here our best argument may be simply to argue that mitsubishi has not borne its legal burden to provide a cargoworthy ship based on david and neales suggestion i have asked david to approach mitsubishis solicitors on an informal basis to discuss three qcs that david and neale find acceptable and determine whether mitsubishis solicitors also find them acceptable once that occurs i will revert back to each of you with a recommendation of a single arbitrator that should hopefully occur today or tomorrowi will continue to keep you advisedbritt

we are on our strategy maybe a telephone call would be best let me know when you are available i can call you early am or late pm re the bug issue we were aware of this although i am interested to hear that sgs raised it with you and eric in midoctober i have discussed this in the past with david best and spoke with him on the telephone this morning about what sgs told you we dont think we should put anyone on notice about the bug issue unless and until it appears and is confirmed at the joint testing otherwise we may be raising an inherent vice argument for both mitsubishi and our own cargo underwriters let me know if you have a different view on this or anything else i put in this email re mitsubishis response to our settlement demand david best has just spoken with sian heard mitsubishis lead london solicitor it is clear from her that mitsubishi will not be settling prior to instituting arbitration it is also clear that mitsubishi will not consider any substantial settlement without heards advice best believes that heard will recommend that the joint testing take place before giving mitsubishi an exposure evaluation in sum while our attempt at settlement prior to joint testing was a worthwhile effort to avoid the risk and expense of the problematic joint survey it now appears to david and me to be at a dead endre the joint testing again david and i believe that the joint testing should proceed as quickly as it can be arranged neither our cargo underwriters nor mitsubishi will move off dead center unless we do so given the problems with sgss lab in singapore the bug issue that sgs in subic bay has raised again and that sgs did the prepurchase of product for ect that proved offspec i have asked david to revisit with steve jones our chemist the logistics and cost of having the testing done in the uk i have also asked him to consider whether heard might be amenable to splitting the costs of transporting the samples from singapore to the uk i would like to get ects authority quickly to authorize the joint testing to go forwardre the selection of arbitrators david has discussed three qcs that he and neale agreed were appropriate with hearn of those three hearn likes nicholas hamblin who will charge pounds an hour and pounds per day she will be conferring with mitsubishi about using him as the sole arbitrator given that we have initiated a goodfaith discussion of the choice of arbitrators with mitsubishi david advises that we do not need to worry about sending mitsubishi a letter tomorrow with our choices of arbitrator on it we can wait for hearn to respond then i will make a formal request for your authority to agree to one arbitrator who has already been accepted by mitsubishire the withoutprejudice settlement of mitsubishis freight and demurrage i read you loud and clear and thanks for making clear that the freight claim is only about not as i had inadvertantly indicated in my last email as i previously mentioned david

your reply which is noted you will notice i have excluded david best and ngregson preferring to keep my comments in house as privileged info unless you feel this msg should be forwarded to them laterfirstly i am getting nowhere with mitsubishi on the settlement front i have gone so far as to mention this morning to mitsuru that if this does goes to arbitration and should mitsubishi succeed in their position this will only serve to increase our claim by a similar amount since these costs would then become part of our contamination claim he seems quite content to let this go to arbitration as an example he was suppose to call me back this afternoon but did notsecondly with regards to your comments i would just respondadd the following information i dont know if i am switching tactics so much as following what should have been done in the beginning ie submit the claim to our insurance company and let them proceed against the owners i honestly feel the arbitrators will say pay the freight and possibly the demurrage now and settle the contamination claim as a separate issue clearly the cp says that freight is due without deduction once the vessel has completed dischargeon the issue of the presale survey i have discussed this matter internally with eric tan seems our position is that singapore considered the sample that was drawn as a bad sample as well as we were not sure that the test methods used conformed with the testing methods required for first gas this position is proved by the loading of the pacific virgo when the product subsequently tested onspec for first gas granted it might still become an issue but as you say it could become an issue in either proceedingi am getting a little confused on the matter of the joint testing verbally i was advised that enron did not want to have the joint testing at least not on a prompt basis your msg now says that we do want to test the product and it should be done as soon as possible as mitsubishi and your advices that the underwriters and hear owners p and i club would want i assume this change is the result of the arbitration be that as it may i do have a bit of information that you may or may not be aware of or find relevant when eric tan and i visited first gas in midoct to meet the personnel at first gas and witness one of the cargoes being discharged at the plant we also took the opportunity to meet with sgs in subic bay to see their facilities and meet their personnel during the conversation the subject of the elang cargo came up and the comment from sgs is that they were fairly certain it was offspec due to bugs this may sound silly but i have heard of this before and is a problem with petroleum productsit seems sgs even went so far as to test the product themselves for these bugs and got a positive result this test was not requested by enron or first gas and was done some time later in this process i understand there may be some concern on our part over our subsequent sales to third parties if we knew there were bugs in the product i would have to say that this was not known at the time and even today is only conjecture based on sgs advices midoct well after these sales sgs also described changes to the product which would fit with the cargo having bugs ie a strong sulphur smell and change in colourif the testing is now done i do not know if these bugs will be detected or not however if they are in the ships samples they may have changed the sample sufficiently that even a visual observation may detect the problem the next problem becomes proving from where the bugs originated were they in the previous cargo tanks that were not cleaned properly or were they in the condensate when the cargo was loaded obviously testing of the shore sample prior to loading will determine the answer if the shore sample is ok then they had to come from the ship if the shore sample also has bugs then we should be claiming against our suppliersthis of course assumes the suggestion put forth by sgs is in fact correct just something else to be considered i am not saying that we pay the full amount immediately but only the freight portion about we then advise mitsubishi or their lawyers that we will now review the demurrage claim about and revert by say end nov the demurrage claim has been sent to our london offices demurrage department and i have asked them for their comments on the claim after all there may be issues with the ships pumping performance or simple laytime errors which may reduce the demurrage claim they will try to get me a response before the weekendin this manner we pay part of the money but still have a smaller portion which we may apply against our claim once the test results are known i will leave this to legal as to decide how the approach to mitsubishi or their lawyers should be madergds 
pacific_virgo ::::::>>>>>> in re mv pacific virgo richardthis follows up on my telephone conference with you of a moment ago this case has taken a significant turn for the worse from ects standpointas you know we began the joint testing of the product samples in the uk this week the testing began with the loadport samples which are the most critical we concentrated on the filterable dirt spec an area in which we believed we had the best chance of proving our case however the tests showed that the loadport samples are considerably off spec for filterable dirt you may recall that sgs had found the loadport samples on spec in all respects the results of the joint testing reportedly caught all the chemists in attendance by surpriseas will not surprise you the chemists present for mitsubishi and our cargo underwriters gave the impression that they felt no further testing was necessary under the circumstancesthere are three possible explanations that we are considering regarding the difference between sgss results at loadport and the results during the joint testing this week sgss results are not credible unfortunately this would tend to be supported by the presale analysis by ect of the same or similar product that if my memory is correct was somewhat off spec for filterable dirt the age of the samples which were taken midyear last year may be a factor and the bug earlier reported by sgs if it exists may be a factori have spoken this morning about further strategy with david best and jim studdert we agreed that steve jones our chemist would suggest a hiatus in the testing giving him time to send us a written report on his findings it would also give him time to hopefully liaise with paul henking and have paul arrange an interview with the sgs surveyor who suggested that the cargo might have a bug in it given the lack of specs in the contract with the supplier it appears to me that we would have to find something significantly wrong with the product that falls outside even the very loose elang crude fit for export purposes language in order to have some cause of action against the supplierjim will contact our cargo underwriters and obtain a preliminary impression from them on how they see the case at this timei will continue to keep you advisedbrittpspaul i would appreciate it if you could call david best tomorrow and get the ball rolling on the bug issue please dont put anything in writing about this issue for steve jones yet 
pacific_virgo ::::::>>>>>> re pacific virgo richardfyi per my voicemail of a moment ago while i appreciate matt having raised the possibility of ect making a bad situation worse by finding a bug i am not inclined to stop the testing i agree with david bests sense that if there is a bug in the product at the time it was loaded from the suppliers mooring facility and if mitsubishi or an enduser comes after ect with a claim that eg the bug contaminated the ships later cargoes the presence of bug in the product would seem to give us a pretty good argument against the supplier in this case a phillips entityplease also keep in mind that our testing is not just for a bug but also to see whether the possibility of the aging of the cargo may have caused the loadport samples to failif we stop the testing now our chances of recovering any settlement from mitsubishi or the cargo underwriters are remote in fact jim studdert just advised that he spoke with the local adjuster for our cargo underwritersand was told i dont think it was an insurable claim if it was contaminated when it was loaded aboard the ship this statement was not a surprise to jim or me by copy of this i wonder if mike could send to me a copy of the general terms and conditions that david best references belowbritt helengodelclydecouk pm to brittdavisenroncom paulhenkingenroncom ngregsonwfwcom matthiasleeenroncom alanaronowitzenroncom jamespstuddertenroncom cc subject pacific virgowe are into the third day of testing in a series of analytical tests thatwill be complete on friday with full results available by the middle ofnext weekit is not possible at this stage to point a finger at anyone since testingis only midway matt lee has raised a concern about carrying on testingparticularly biological testing to be undertaken on friday if it is onlygoing to expose enron further without any recourse against the supplierswere the testing to stop now we will have incomplete analyses with twosets of loadport data that are in conflict this will make the chances ofa recovery against ship and suppliers very difficult in my view jimstuddert has offered the opinion that it would be very difficult to make arecovery from underwriters with the results as they are at present stevejones inclination is to carry on to try and get a firmer view it may bethat the ship is still the villain of the piece because even the loadportresults that have just come out do not match the kind of filterable dirtthat is present in the discharge samples ie there is an increasebiological contamination if present could also mean involvement of theship particularly if the loadport results are clean or not nearly as badas the discharge port results on the other hand if biologicalcontamination is shown to be present in the loadport samples at the samekind of level as the discharge port samples clearly the finger pointsstraight at the suppliers and not at underwriters and at the ship i thinkthe suppliers will have a case to answer bearing in mind they contractedto sell elang blend ultralight crude oil of normal export quality at timeand place of loading i will be surprised if normal export quality meansthat the cargo can carry bugs can someone fax to me the enron generalterms conditions applicable to crude oil petroleum and petrochemicaltransactions effective st january which are incorporated in thephillips petroleum contract with enron capital trade resources singaporei should like to take a look at themwere we to break now midway through the anlaysis i am sure underwritersexpert would immediately talk to his principals who will ask the obviousquestion why we stopped to this extent i think we shall have to carry onto try to get nearer to the truth or something that approaches itif anybody has different views and wants to stop right now will theyplease let me know immediatelyregardsdavid bestthis email and any attachments are confidential and may also be privileged if you are not the named recipient please notify the sender immediately and do not disclose the contents to any other person use it for any purpose or store or copy the informationin the event of any technical difficulty with this email please contact the sender or the london it department on clyde co eastcheap london ecm jptel fax clyde co guildfordbeaufort house chertsey street guildford gu hatel fax email postmasterclydecouk internet httpwwwclydecocom

enron capital trade singapore pte ltd ect in the abovereferenced alleged cargo contamination matter as its london solicitor again you will be liaising with neale gregson of watson farleys office in singapore who will continue to perform the factual development on this case for ect subject to your direction and supervision matt lee ects inhouse attorney in singapore will set up a telephone conference with you and neale for some time tomorrow prior to opening of business in houston in case you need to get in touch with him the telephone number i use for matt is i believe neals number is i will call you tomorrow at pm london time am houston time to touch base with youfacts the following is a thumbnail of the facts that have been reported to me i have not had a chance to run this summary past matt and would be grateful for any corrections he might like to make ect purchased a quantity of elang crude suitable for export from phillips petroleum company phillips and voyagechartered the mv pacific virgo from mitsubishi corporation mitsubishithe timecharterer to carry it from phillips offshore loading facility in indonesia to thailand and the phillipines for use by the buyer first gas power corporation fgpc as compressor fuel there exists a longterm compressor fuel agreement between ect and fgpc that contains several specifications that the product needed to pass the agreement between ect and phillips does not mention any of these specifications one of the specifications at issue from the ectfgpc agreement is astm d which is used to test for the presence of certain metals according to ects surveyors astm d apparently does not produce test results that are sufficiently reproducible to be useful ect has apparently been trying for some months to convince fgpc of this but without success fgpc reportedly advises that seimens from whom it purchased the compressors at issue might void its warranty to fgpc if fuel is used that does not meet astm d a separate specification from the ectfgpc agreement for sediments may also become at issue months before the product at issue was loaded ect had elang crude from this same facility tested to determine whether it would meet the fgpc specifications and found that the elang crude was onspec for astm d but offspec for sedimentation again a test separate and apart from astm d by almost double the allowed amount it is not clear why ect decided to purchase product from phillips despite this test it is unknown at this time whether this test included any of the product later loaded at some point prior to loading ect did put the ship on notice that the cargo had to meet specifications for use as compressor fuel the ship responded by recommending that the tanks be butterworthed at an extra cost per the cp to ect of ect declined apparently opting for a less expensive fresh water rinse reportedly the ship then advised that it did not have sufficient fresh water to perform a fresh water as opposed to seawater rinse i am not sure what tank cleaning ultimately took place or who paid for it sgs ects surveyors did deliver a dry certificate to us before loading the ship loaded bbls per bl at the modec venture phillips floating offshore facility in indonesia from june testing of the shore tanks at loading revealed that the elang crude did meet the specifications in the fgpc contract ect paid phillips an fob price of for the cargo after loading in indonesia the ship then proceeded to thailand where from june it offloaded bbls for storage for the eventual use of fgpc no quality testing of the product was apparently done aboard or ashore at that time the ship thereafter sailed to the phillipines for offloading the remainder of the cargo upon offloading in the phillipines the cargo was found offspec for the presence of metals and sediment fgpc rejected the cargo wilson farley opined that fgpc was squarely within its contractual rights to do so ect placed all potentially liable parties on notice and resold the cargo remaining on board to lg caltex caltex reportedly a korean refinery on a cif outturn basis for what i understand to be only a small approximately reduction in the value of the cargo ect will not know exactly what it will be paid by the korean refinery until the end of august as the purchase was based on an august price index that cargo discharged in korea and received by caltex directly into its crude oil storage facility on july it appears that caltex did not do any quality inspection before this occurred no protest or objection to the quality of the cargo has been received from caltex ect is attempting to find another buyer for the elang crude currently in storage in thailand as it is apparently unsuitable for fgpcs use there as well matt will know whether that product has been tendered to and rejected by fgpc mitsubishi has tendered an invoice for approximately freight for the voyage from the phillipines to korea and has submitted an invoice for approximately for demurrage for the voyage from indonesia to the phillipines ect has already paid approximately freight for the voyage from indonesia to the phillipines parenthetically two different charter parties were used one for the voyage from indonesia to the phillipines and one for the voyage from the phillipines to korea a number of samples of the cargo were taken at the modec venture in thailand and the phillipines at surveys that appear to have been jointly attended by ect ects cargo underwriters and ownerspi as i understand it the reports of the various analyses done to date are somewhat confusing a joint analysis is being planned to take place in singapore unfortunately the seals on a number of samples were broken by sgs our surveyors however my hope is that there are a number of other samples that can serve the same purpose ect has also retained a captain sawant of pacmarine to act as an independent expert for us in this matter captain sawant has prepared a report and there is a watson farley memo containing notes of an interview of him as i understand his report captain sawant believes that the contamination probably took place aboard ship as a result of a inadequate cleaning of the tanks and b the cleansing properties of this condensate cargo a related issue of great importance to ect is fgpcs position going forward regarding what i understand to be a longterm compressor fuel purchase agreement under the agreement there are reportedly three alternative fuels which ect may given certain conditions deliver to fgpc condensate gasoil and naptha condensate is apparently the first choice but must meet astm d which ect now feels is extremely difficult to do given the unreliability of the test gasoil can reportedly only be used where ect has been unable despite the use of due diligence to locate condensate that meets astm d if fgpc accepts gasoil as a substitute however then fgpc is responsible for paying a substantial tax on it that does not apply to condensate naptha will reportedly cause ect to lose money because of its lower btu content because of the problems with the mv pacific virgo product ect has reportedly contacted fgpc about accepting gasoil as a substitute i have heard that this will cause fgpc to become liable for a tax in the range of although this has not been confirmed before agreeing to accept gasoil fgpc has requested a letter advising what due diligence efforts ect has performed in order to secure product that does meet its specs parenthetically i ask that matt remind me who the ect trader was who actually did this deal urgent issues who to use as ects experts neale has recommended captain richard gregory of noble denton and dr eric mullen of burgoynes i do not know whether neale intends to use captain sawant who has reportedly never testified i feel that the quality of ects experts will be of great significance in this case and want to make sure that whoever we use can in your opinion command the respect of a london arbitration tribunal in a proceeding against the ship or if necessary against the cargo underwriters if that means getting a londonbased expert lets discuss it and get this issue resolved before the joint survey that is being scheduled to take place in the phillipines resolving ects insurance claim as you know cliff bennett of mintons the same firm that enron is using as its experts in the mv havmann matter is following this matter for ects cargo underwriters i am told that bennett has not been told by us about the presale product sampling my concern is that once he finds out he and the ship will raise inherent vice as a defense please take a look at the cargo policy that i will be sending you by courier and a advise of any coverage issues you see and b give us your thoughts as to the best way of resolving ects claim quickly whether ect should file for arbitration before the ship does so you mentioned that the ship is likely to file an arbitration demand in the near future and seek an interim award of its freight claim given that i would like your recommendation in very short order as to whether ect should wait for that to happen and file a counterclaim or proceed with filing an original demand whether ect can raise the doctrines of impossibility of performance or frustration of performance or some other legal theory to challenge the use by fgpc of the astm d specification in this matteradditional documentation this afternoon i will be faxing certain key documents to you and will send the rest by courier i am also asking that matt telefax to you copies of the following documents matt i apologize if you have already sent them to me ects purchase agreement with phillips ects longterm agreement to supply fuel to fgpc and purchase orders or the like that particularly relate to this cargo a copy of the first charter party as soon as it is sent to us anything which reflects the terms of the second charter party david we

david best given that we already put underwriters on notice that there was contamination and given that we have worked closely with mintons underwriters representatives i would assume that we are under no time pressure to give underwriters a total quantum before the joint survey takes place in fact it looks like the final determination of ects total quantum of damages may be impacted by the results of the joint survey although i would not necessarily want to say that to underwriters at this point my preliminary review of the policy reflects no language in the policy which would require ect to immediately provide a total quantum the policy specifically requires under instructions in case of loss that ect file a claim in writing against the delivering carrier holding him responsible as soon as loss or damage is discovered even though the full exent thereof is not apparent details can be furnished later such action will not prejudice your insurance claim let me know if you would

testing may encompass bothcomposites and in some cases individual tank samples where particulatesare involved the composition of individual tank samples even in alaboratory can destroy the representivity of a sample this by the way isthe reason for my concerns over sample decanting in philippines evidencecan be lost testingi would suggest the laboratory of sgs singapore because that is where thesamples are being collated provided the testing can be done to theappropriate standard and the methods are available any laboratory woulddoas advised previously the laboratory tests and the

astm dbsw astm dv na k ca pb astm dfilterable dirt astm dplease note that for filterable dirt astm d is not applicable as itis designed for insitu line samples astm d is a laboratory methodthatis essentially equivalent both methods are intended for particulates inaviation fuels anyway sgs singapore can run astm dthe above suite of tests should be run on all selected samples it willalmost certainly not be necessary to test all available samples induplicate duplicates are necessary because standalone results arealwaysopen to doubt in any event duplicates are often a requirement of the testmethod and any reputable laboratory will run duplicates as a matter ofcourse duplicate samples should not mean twice the price investigative testingthis is more difficult to predict in terms of exactly what will benecessary to a degree it will be guided by what is found in the abovespec testing my initial recommendation would be to check the solubilityof the particulates particularly in aromatic solvent to check if organicand possibly in acid to check if inorganicif as has so far been reported the particulates are not aromatic solventsoluble and because they do not appear to contribute to the ash content ofthe fuel a best guess might be that they are carbon particles howeverwe need to keep an open mind on thiswe might need to think about microscopy visible or electron on theparticles possibly also look at elemental analysis of the particles byegenergy dispersive xray analysisi will give some further thought to what might be required by way ofinvestigative analysis and revert at this stage i suggest that alloptionson the investigative side are kept open ownerspi might not agree butrealistically we cannot predict what we will find or what might need to bedone until

project_stanley ::::::>>>>>> project stanley recent meetings with alberta government and transalta privileged and confidentialplease note i have not sent this memo to gpc meeting with alberta department of resource developmentrick shapiro aleck dadson and i met with two senior officials from the alberta department of resource development last week larry charach executive director electricity and stan wenger assistant deputy minister gas alberta markets and it is our view that the adrd is not aware of project stanley based on some rather awkward questions we were asked by larry charach relating to our views on whether powerex has complied with the spirit of the rules in alberta meeting with transalta and other alberta marketersi attended a meeting of alberta marketers last week hosted and organized by transaltas trading group transalta proposed the companies in attendance form a coalition whose mandate and objective would be to retain counsel us and canadian along with possibly other experts to assist the coalition in formulating a strategy designed to address concerns of the invited market participants with bc hydro power supply bchydro grid operations and powerexs alleged improper use of the network economy tariff provisions in the bc hydro wholesale transmission tariff the attendees at the meeting included representatives from of the alberta ppa buyers namely enron transcanada power engage energy and enmax along with atco power pancanadian duke energy and aquila in addition although bonneville power administration was not in attendance it was interesting that transalta advised that bpa shared transaltas concerns and was interested in working with this group to address these concerns at the meeting transalta walked the group through a specific example of a situation that occurred in may where transalta alleges that both it and transcanada power were blocked from using scheduled interruptible transmission capacity out of alberta by bc hydro power supply through its use of the network economy provisions in the bc hydro wholesale transmission tariff which has a higher priority than interruptible transmission during a period when prices were considerably higher in the pacific northwest than in alberta as a result of the interruption of transaltas and transcanadas interruptible transmission reservation transmission capacity between albertabc border and bcus border became available and was immediately acquired by bc hydro power supply and used to support powerex exports during these periods into the us transalta estimates the opportunity cost of this curtailment to transalta was milliontransaltas frustration is no surprise to enron canada i can advise that i wrote a memo to john lavorato dated march in which i reviewed enrons concerns regarding the behavior of bc hydro power supply and powerex that is very similar to the allegations presented by transalta the purpose of my memo to john l was to outline my initial thoughts on what enron canada may wish to do to attempt to stop this abuse and was focused on the idea of proceeding with a complaint to ferc that bc hydro power supply and powerex were exercising transmission market power enron canada did not pursue this any further at the timeamong the ideas reviewed by transalta with the group to address and rectify the abuse it alleges exist on the transmission path between alberta and the us pacific northwest included i a complaint to adrd and a request they become involved ii a complaint to the alberta market surveillance administrator iii a complaint to ferc iv a complaint to the bcuc v a complaint to the bc government vi a complaint to the neb vii a complaint to the competition bureau andor viii a nafta complaint with respect to transaltas comments relating to the competition bureau they advised the group that they have spoken to the competition bureau about their concerns and were told by the competition bureau that it is monitoring the alberta electricity market based on the description provided by transalta of its discussions with the competition bureau and other comments made by transalta at the meeting i do not believe transalta is aware of project stanley i believe the comments made by the transalta trader enrons trader last month about the competition bureau were not about project stanley but were in the context of transalta complaining to the competition bureau about bc hydro power supply and powerexs alleged abuse of the network economy provisions in the tariff the next step in the coalition building process is a meeting on september of those companies that wish to proceed to form a coalition the idea is that the coalition members would work out the terms of confidentiality documentation prior to any member sharing historical information that it may wish to provide relating to potential abuses by bc hydro power supply or powerex in addition they intend to begin to consider which of the possible courses of action described above would be most effective it appears from the discussion at the initial meeting that the option that involves a complaint to ferc is the most favored by transalta at this time finally they intend to discuss a preliminary budget which transalta suggested may be in the range of cdn if the group elects to proceed with a complaint to fercthere are without question a number of reasons why a decision that enron canada should not even consider having any part of this coalition in view of the project stanley matter is the safest strategy having said this enron canada has a significant commercial interest in seeing this coalition with or without enron achieve its objective to reduce or eliminate bc hydro power supplys and powerexs ability to use the network economy service to block its competitors from access to import capacity into alberta and export capacity into the us enron canadas recent acquisition of the alberta sundance b ppa mw of capacity dispatch rights in alberta makes this issue even more commercially significant as the ability to contract for transmission capacity without the risk of a reasonable probability of curtailment as a result of bc hydro power supply invoking network economy service would represent a significant risk mitigant for enrons sundance b long position there is also some benefit of participating in the coalition to influence the direction it takes and to stay abreast of what it is doingi have discussed the matter with rob milnthorp and he agrees that the decision to participate in the coalition would obviously have to be considered and approved by those managing the project stanley issue if the decision of the project stanley team is that enron canada must steer clear of this coalition because of project stanley then rob m and other commercial guys in ena who do business with powerex will not need to give further consideration to additional reasons why enron canada may elect not participate such as i the implications on enron canadas and enas commercial relationship with powerex ii whether enron canada would be prepared to commit to anything more than attending the first meeting of the coalition with a view to understanding the nature of the confidentiality obligations the favored course of action and the budget iii whether enron canada would explicitly reserve the right to withdraw from the coalition at any time and iv whether enron would want to be in a coalition with bpa who i understand we believe may also be engaged in exercising transmission market power to complicate this further enron canada is presently being sued by transalta over the interpretation of the wording in two swap transactions and rob milnthorp has indicated that enron canada will not agree to participate in any coalition with transalta unless and until transalta discontinues this lawsuit i look forward to your comments and feedback on this issueregardsrob

alberta had when they were setting up the power pool and more particularly whether they envisioned that unsophisticated pool participant would be expected to obtain assistance from other more sophisticated pool participants to maximize the price that it would receive from the power pool for the energy it sold into the power pool i have reviewed the some materials ie aeub decisions alberta department of energy documents and have found nothing related to this this is not surprising as these market design issues were considered in alberta in and long before i arrived on the electricity scene in i did speak to a consultant who was involved in the market design process in the early s named jim fitzowich jim joined transalta in and then worked for transcanada power until january when he established his current consulting practice jim became a member of the power pool council in late and stayed in that position until may when an independent power pool council was appointed jim and i are both on the board of directors of the independent power producers society of alberta and i know jim fairly well jim advised that the alberta electricity industry design was quarterbacked by the deputy minister of energy of the day named rick hyndman under rick hyndmans direction a white paper was apparently released in october in which a power exchange regime modelled on the exchange regime in the uk was thoroughly discussed and proposed for alberta according to jim fitzowich this white paper was the initial blueprint for the alberta market design i have met rick hyndman a few times and understand he left government a few years ago and is also a consultant i left rick a message to call me and i intend to ask him to send me a copy of the white paper and also inquire about the nature of his consulting work on a related note attached is an email i sent to bill g and john l in march advising them of the new power pool participant behavior guidelines that were added to the power pool rules in march you can see the original notice of the rule change received from the power pool is also attached as are the actual participant behavior guidelines see change a while i appreciate the determination of whether an offence occurred under the competition act would be independent of the compliance or not with the power pool rules i think it is noteworthy that the power pool incorporated these entirely new set of participant behavior guidelines only recently and after the acts that are the subject of project stanley had occurred you should also be aware that there is a document on the power pool website httpwwwpowerpoolabcaindexlinkshtml entitled summary of power pool rule changes that appears to list all the rule changes that have occurred since the power pool began operation in regardsrob forwarded by robert hemstockcalect on pm from robert hemstock pm to bill greenizancalectect john j lavoratocalectectcc aleck dadsontorectect peter keohanecalectect subject alberta power pool rule changesattached are a number of pool rule changes that i expect will be approved today by the power pool council the most noteworthy change is the addition of the new rule participant behavior guidelinesthe participant behavior guidelines contain very broad language but are intended to provide market participants with guidance from the pool on the types of activities that it considers to constitute anticompetitive behavior it identifies three categories of undesireable practices namely a sharing of competitive information b abuse of dominant position which includes physical or economic witholding of facilities or energy so as to adversely impact upon the efficient fair and openly competitive operation of the market and c other practices including conduct that would cause a material change in pricein my view this new rule does not extend any additional powers to the power pool or the market survelliance administrator beyond the already broad authority given to the msa in section of the electric utilities act it is my sense from conversations i had with stakeholders at the ippsa conference that the power pools motivation behind this new rule was to send a message to powerex and the ppa owners that the power pool is concerned about their market power and iswill be monitoring them we need to be aware of these rules so we can mitigate the risk of our business not being conducted within them it may be worthwhile for peter and i to consolidate the relevant eua provisions and the pool rules into one reference resource for the commercial group

project_stanley ::::::>>>>>> re project stanley recent meetings with alberta government andtransalta privileged and confidentiali read your message regarding the meeting with transalta and other alberta marketers with interest my immediate thoughts are as followsobviously you should keep the discussions entirely to problems experienced with bc hydropowerex foreclosure of transmission capacityif the project proceeds the coalititon should appoint a limited number of people to carry the project and report back to participantsthe working group should ensure that their proceedings include outside counsel who had or have some knowledge of antitrust as well as the regulatory issuesthe coalition should stay as close as possible to government for example they should try to involve alberta officials in the project if possiblemy guess is the competition bureau will take the view that regulatorys bc neb ferc have primary jurisdiction but the bureau may be an ally in dealing with regulators do you know who at the bureau transalta talked to about their concerns this may also have some bearing on the extent to which enron should openly participate in the project texthtm

that were the decision we would make absent stanley we did nothing wrong in stanley and this is an issue ie bc hydropowerex transmission market power that needs to be remedied i would also ask milnthorp to reconsider his objection to participating while were in litigation i think on issues like this where we have common ground that are unrelated to the litigation we need to rise above it

government and transaltaprivileged and confidentialplease note i have not sent this memo to gpc meeting with alberta department of resource developmentrick shapiro aleck dadson and i met with two senior officials from the alberta department of resource development last week larry charach executive director electricity and stan wenger assistant deputy minister gas alberta markets and it is our view that the adrd is not aware of project stanley based on some rather awkward questions we were asked by larry charach relating to our views on whether powerex has complied with the spirit of the rules in alberta meeting with transalta and other alberta marketersi attended a meeting of alberta marketers last week hosted and organized by transaltas trading group transalta proposed the companies in attendance form a coalition whose mandate and objective would be to retain counsel us and canadian along with possibly other experts to assist the coalition in formulating a strategy designed to address concerns of the invited market participants with bc hydro power supply bchydro grid operations and powerexs alleged improper use of the network economy tariff provisions in the bc hydro wholesale transmission tariff the attendees at the meeting included representatives from of the alberta ppa buyers namely enron transcanada power engage energy and enmax along with atco power pancanadian duke energy and aquila in addition although bonneville power administration was not in attendance it was interesting that transalta advised that bpa shared transaltas concerns and was interested in working with this group to address these concerns at the meeting transalta walked the group through a specific example of a situation that occurred in may where transalta alleges that both it and transcanada power were blocked from using scheduled interruptible transmission capacity out of alberta by bc hydro power supply through its use of the network economy provisions in the bc hydro wholesale transmission tariff which has a higher priority than interruptible transmission during a period when prices were considerably higher in the pacific northwest than in alberta as a result of the interruption of transaltas and transcanadas interruptible transmission reservation transmission capacity between albertabc border and bcus border became available and was immediately acquired by bc hydro power supply and used to support powerex exports during these periods into the us transalta estimates the opportunity cost of this curtailment to transalta was milliontransaltas frustration is no surprise to enron canada i can advise that i wrote a memo to john lavorato dated march in which i reviewed enrons concerns regarding the behavior of bc hydro power supply and powerex that is very similar to the allegations presented by transalta the purpose of my memo to john l was to outline my initial thoughts on what enron canada may wish to do to attempt to stop this abuse and was focused on the idea of proceeding with a complaint to ferc that bc hydro power supply and powerex were exercising transmission market power enron canada did not pursue this any further at the timeamong the ideas reviewed by transalta with the group to address and rectify the abuse it alleges exist on the transmission path between alberta and the us pacific northwest included i a complaint to adrd and a request they become involved ii a complaint to the alberta market surveillance administrator iii a complaint to ferc iv a complaint to the bcuc v a complaint to the bc government vi a complaint to the neb vii a complaint to the competition bureau andor viii a nafta complaint with respect to transaltas comments relating to the competition bureau they advised the group that they have spoken to the competition bureau about their concerns and were told by the competition bureau that it is monitoring the alberta electricity market based on the description provided by transalta of its discussions with the competition bureau and other comments made by transalta at the meeting i do not believe transalta is aware of project stanley i believe the comments made by the transalta trader enrons trader last month about the competition bureau were not about project stanley but were in the context of transalta complaining to the competition bureau about bc hydro power supply and powerexs alleged abuse of the network economy provisions in the tariff the next step in the coalition building process is a meeting on september of those companies that wish to proceed to form a coalition the idea is that the coalition members would work out the terms of confidentiality documentation prior to any member sharing historical information that it may wish to provide relating to potential abuses by bc hydro power supply or powerex in addition they intend to begin to consider which of the possible courses of action described above would be most effective it appears from the discussion at the initial meeting that the option that involves a complaint to ferc is the most favored by transalta at this time finally they intend to discuss a preliminary budget which transalta suggested may be in the range of cdn if the group elects to proceed with a complaint to fercthere are without question a number of reasons why a decision that enron canada should not even consider having any part of this coalition in view of the project stanley matter is the safest strategy having said this enron canada has a significant commercial interest in seeing this coalition with or without enron achieve its objective to reduce or eliminate bc hydro power supplys and powerexs ability to use the network economy service to block its competitors from access to import capacity into alberta and export capacity into the us enron canadas recent acquisition of the alberta sundance b ppa mw of capacity dispatch rights in alberta makes this issue even more commercially significant as the ability to contract for transmission capacity without the risk of a reasonable probability of curtailment as a result of bc hydro power supply invoking network economy service would represent a significant risk mitigant for enrons sundance b long position there is also some benefit of participating in the coalition to influence the direction it takes and to stay abreast of what it is doingi have discussed the matter with rob milnthorp and he agrees that the decision to participate in the coalition would obviously have to be considered and approved by those managing the project stanley issue if the decision of the project stanley team is that enron canada must steer clear of this coalition because of project stanley then rob m and other commercial guys in ena who do business with powerex will not need to give further consideration to additional reasons why enron canada may elect not participate such as i the implications on enron canadas and enas commercial relationship with powerex ii whether enron canada would be prepared to commit to anything more than attending the first meeting of the coalition with a view to understanding the nature of the confidentiality obligations the favored course of action and the budget iii whether enron canada would explicitly reserve the right to withdraw from the coalition at any time and iv whether enron would want to be in a coalition with bpa who i understand we believe may also be engaged in exercising transmission market power to complicate this further enron canada is presently being sued by transalta over the interpretation of the wording in two swap transactions and rob milnthorp has indicated that enron canada will not agree to participate in any coalition with transalta unless and until transalta discontinues this lawsuit i look forward to your comments and feedback on this issueregardsrob 
project_stanley ::::::>>>>>> re project stanley our file sent on behalf of web macdonald with respect to rob hemstocks email of august st and richard sanders and glenn leslies comments of this morning it would appear that the coalition being discussed could have a major benefit to enron and in the normal course of events would be something that enron would participate inhaving said this rob hemstocks comment that the safest course of action is not to participate is accuratein the event that enron determines to proceed with the coalition notwithstanding project stanley it is my view that a low key role with the right to withdraw from the coalition at any time may be the appropriate way to go given that as project stanley proceeds we are going to have to work hand in hand with powerex from time to timein my view this is something that we should consider further in the next few days 
project_stanley ::::::>>>>>> project stanley blakes account got your voice mail my thoughts are the following i always insist that there is a breakdown of accounts by lawyer name hourly rate and task description if it is not in this account i do not know why and i think it is appropriate that you ask for it and receive it i would have expected the account to be large and that there are a number of people involved i lost involvement at the direction of delainey and milnthorp early in this project after the initial crisis management stage but my observations of the number of people and resources involved are the following at the outset we needed a number of people to manage the search and related technical and legal issues in the short term over the longer term staffing requirements ought to be greatly reduced and it seems that since the original crisis management stage the file has been over staffed at the same time in fairness i believe blakes feels that the are responding to the requirements of enron to throw al ot of resources at the project if it has not already happened i believe you should speak to dan fournier to confirm our expectations and to discuss rationalizing resources as i say i was asked to step back from this project but i am happy to have this discussion with dan fournier if you preferalso i did not receive a copy of the account but it seems to me that at our direction blakes hired a number of economic and political consultants which will also be greatly expensive and which will as i understand be billed to blakes and included in blakes accounts as disbursements to maintain privilege if it has not already happened i also believe the use of the consultants also needs to be rationalizedi also expect that ve will have a not insignificant accountin summary since the initial stage i have had limited involvement but i am not surprised and would have expected that the account is large and i expect that larger accounts are coming once consultant accounts start to roll in i believe that detailed account breakdowns are appropriate but also that the use of all consultants including blakes needs to be rationalized i also believe that blakes has done an excellent job and that a lot was be asked of them in the early stages and therefore they were throwing a lot of resources to the projectlastly in anticipation that this would be expensive and that there would be a number of people involved rob milnthorp initially spoke to john lavorato about setting up a separate houston rc for the project which john agreed to the rc number i gave you may have been a canadian rc and i need to confirm with accounting in any event i will be sending a subsequent email to all internal groups to make sure that all expenses internal and external are billed to that separate rcpeterplease let me know if i can be of any help

for alberta price fixing new york by cheryl devoe kim of dow jones newswires toronto dow jonescanadas competition bureau raided the offices of enroncanada corp in calgary and powerex corp in vancouver earlier this year aspart of an investigation into suspected electricity price fixing by the twocompanies according to documents obtained by dow jones newswires bureau investigator david bloom alleges in an application for a warrant heused to gain access to the offices that in the summer of powerex andenron were coordinating bid restatements and inflating the price each receivedfor electricity as they traded on the power pool of alberta the investigation hasnt yet produced any charges against either of thecompanies according to enron the competition bureau declined to comment onthe status of the case both enron corp ene which owns enron canada and powerex a unit ofprovincially owned british columbia hydro power authority xbch denybreaking any rules or laws from powerexs point of view albertans are looking for someone to blame forhigh power prices which have become a political issue in the province they just find it easy to blame us for what are pretty fundamental marketdesign flaws powerex president and chief executive ken peterson told dowjones newswires in an interview deregulation spurs search for someone to blame the search for someone to blame has repeated itself across every deregulatingmarket enron has participated in enron corp spokesman mark palmer said almost every time that either power markets or natural gas markets or evenoil markets or gasoline markets have experienced any kind of price volatilitythere have been investigations done palmer said enron has been scrutinized before as part of wider energy marketsinvestigations he said but never found to be breaking the rules this is thefirst such investigation into powerexs actions peterson said the competition bureau based in ottawa wont say whether the investigaionis ongoing citing disclosure rules under the competition act the companies themselves said theyre not sure of the investigations statustheir seized files were returned several months ago but powerex hasnt heardfrom the bureau since then enron did receive a call from the bureau last weekwith a question according to enron corp spokesman eric thode the investigation began when the power pool of albertas system controllersnoticed the clearing price for a megawatt of electricity was topping c withunusual frequency the pools price is set by participants submitting bids to buy or sell powerfor the following day until oct a bidder could restate the amountof power in a bid or offer an unlimited number of times until minutesbefore the hour of transmission the price paid for every megawatt of powerneeded by the pool in a given hour is set by the most expensive unit needed tomeet demand alleged bid rigging methods detailed according to the competition bureau search warrant application powerex andenron were rigging their bids in the following manner powerex would lower the volume of an existing offer as little as two minuteslater enron would increase its offer for the same period by the same volumebut at a significantly higher price according to the warrant applicationsometimes enron would increase its offer even before powerex had dropped itsoffer power pool market analyst owen craig who once worked in enron canadas gastrading group found that as a result of restatements involving mostlypowerex and enron the pool price was raised once to cmwh four times tobetween c and c three times to between c and c and times to between c and c based on the restatement patterns craig and then the bureaus bloomconcluded that no new energy was being offered to the pool they believed thepower was just being transferred from powerex to enron and then offered at thehigher price according to the warrant application by cutting the volumeoffered by powerex the more expensive power offered by enron would likely beneeded and every participant would get the higher price powerexs peterson doesnt take issue with the trade history as detailed bythe bureau but denies that the companys traders were doing anything wrong orthat the two companies had some sort of arrangement and were adamant about that peterson said there was no deal with enronthere was no expectation about what their behavior would lead to in terms of achange in prices or anything like that powerex traders were merely locking in their price cutting the companysrisk which enron agreed to take on by buying the power at a fixed pricepeterson said whenever enrons offer of highpriced energy was declined within moments ofenron being advised by the pool that their energy would not be requiredpowerex would restate an identical volume of energy back into its lower pricedunit according to the warrant application petersons response were operating in a very tight market there and wefelt an obligation to make sure the power got delivered into alberta enron also denies it broke any power pool rules or canadian laws it boils down to we were offered power at a price lower than we thought wecould sell it at enrons thode said and thats what enron and every othercompany does thats in the business of trading the may search warrant covers the companies actions between june and oct on oct the pool changed its restatement rulesessentially closing the loophole though it did so without ever making publicits investigation into powerex and enron power pool spokesman wayne st amour declined to discuss details of theinvestigation market surveillance is in place to among other things protect theinterests and activities of market participants he said those convicted under canadian law for bidrigging can be fined an amount atthe courts discretion andor jailed up to five years a conviction wouldntlikely affect powerexs ability to trade in the us peterson said in canadathere would have to have some followon action by the alberta parties toinhibit that and so far they still like to get our power companies concerned about reputations the bigger problem peterson said is what the case will do to the powerexreputation essentially both companies are concerned about it because we have a lot atstake from a reputational point of view peterson said both companies ibelieve conduct themselves in the highest possible standard but these aredifficult times in the business with prices going crazy in alberta andcalifornia and people looking for somebody to blame theres always apossibility of collateral damage when politics gets involved powerex parent company bc hydro is also suspected by the power pool ofalberta of unfairly providing access to transmission through british columbialinking

project_stanley ::::::>>>>>> project stanley immediate amendment to alberta market surveillance rules priveleged and confidentialthe alberta department of resource development adrd released a draft market surveillance amendment regulation today which contains proposed amendments to the current market surveillance regulation that will be in force prior to the ppa auction later this month a number of changes have been made in response to i concerns raised by potential power purchase arrangement bidders about ppa owners intentionally witholding capacity and ii other apparent deficiencies with the original msa regulation we may wish to use the opportunity to informally advocate for a specific change to the ms regulation enron canada will be filing formal written comments on other unrelated issues that would mitigate one of the risks of a negative outcome on project stanleyi understand that blakes has undertaken a review of the eua or market surveillance regulation to determine what sanctions could result from a negative outcome on project stanley and therefore they can confirm whether i have identified all the applicable sections of the eua and regulations that address this issue based on my quick review i see a conflict between the market surveillance regulation and the power pool rulessection of the current market surveillance regulation provides the power pool council with the authority to impose sanctions on market participants that are found to be in contravention of the electric utilities act the regulations the rules of the power pool etc there are four specific sanctions including i fine ii imposition of terms and conditions on the market participants activitives iii direction to the market participant not to engage in certain activity and iv direction to the market participant to pay the costs of an investigation and hearing none of these specific sanction include suspension or revocation of a market participants power pool registration in contrast to section of the market surveillance regulation section d of the eua authorizes the power pool council to change the rules of the power pool rule of the power pool rules allows for the power pool council to revoke a participants registration for having contravened the power pool rules i believe it is necessary to at least consider whether enron canada should call sid carlson the adrd official responsible for the market surveillance amendment regulation and verbally advocate for an amendment to the market surveillance regulation that would serve to expressly remove any conflict between the ms regulation and the power pool rules in relation to the authority of the power pool council to revoke a participants registration an amendment that would limit the authority of the power pool council to the four sanctions in the ms regulation would have the postive effect of eliminating the risk of enron canada being suspended from the power pool and therefore remove one of the risks inherent in enron canadas participation in the ppa auction admittedly there is also a risk that our raising the issue could backfire and result in the adrd entrenching such authority of the power pool council into the regulation and therefore deprive enron canada of arguing in the event of a negative result on project stanley that the power pool council does not have the authority to revoke enron canadas participant registration aleck advises that the imo in ontario has the authority to revoke the registration of a market participant and he is of the view that it is reasonable for the power pool council in alberta to have recourse to such a sanction i understand from dalton mcgrath that blakes is of the view that there is a very low probability of enron canada being sanctioned by way of suspension or revocation of its power pool registration in the event of a negative outcome on project stanley while i appreciate there are pros and cons to saying anything on this issue the ms regulation is not frequently amended and the prospect of there being another opportunity to influence its amendment in this regard prior to the resolution of project stanley is very remote it is for this reason that i raise the matter now as the adrd has indicated it will accept comments only until pm wednesday july regardsrob

px ::::::>>>>>> cal px situation confidentialsubject to attorney client privilegehere is a line of argument which we might consider using to muzzle the px section of the tariff requires the px to keep sensitive information given to the px by participants confidential section says no px participant has the right to review any information that another px participant has designated as confidential section says that if the px thinks it has to disclose information it has to let the participant that will be affected by the disclosure have time to challenge the alleged disclosure requirement px tariff schedule dealing with sanctions says that the terms of section apply in sanction situations schedule is silent about whether or not the px is required or permitted to broadcast sanctions to the market there may be a legal argument based on the tariff that the px has to keep quiet about sanctions are they required or permitted to broadcast to the whole world their findings another line of reasoning based on the tariff which might be worth exploring is as follows if this event had occurred now with the new sanction part of the tariff in effect the px would have had to have conducted an investigation in accordance with section which requires the basis of a finding to be given and if after this relatively fair looking due process section was followed we were found guilty we would have received a level sanction which is a formal warning which shall take the form of a written letter identifying the px participants infraction and nothing more therefore why is the px seeking to solve a problem it had before the tariff was brought up to date on sanctions with a kangaroo court process that is more draconian than its newly approved ferc sanctions it is rather ironic that we have escaped sanctions because they weret organized to impose them when the actions in question occurred but had the present tariff been in effect then we probably would not have been treated so shabbily somehow this has to be able to be turned into a legal argument in our defence cgythese are preliminary thoughts which i think merit further pursuit cgy

px ::::::>>>>>> as the caiso turns caiso involved in scam with cdwr to purchase excess power from cdwrs longterm contracts everyonethis is hot news showing that the caisocdwr relationship is even more cozy than we thought i am not sure how to best use this information but this scam needs to be brought to the publics and fercs attention according to two sources the caiso is helping to bail gov davis out of his highpriced cdwr longterm power contracts by purchasing cdwrs excess energy as an out of market purchaseinstead of purchasing realtime energy from the caisos supplemental energy auction as required by the caiso tariff the costs of purchasing this highcost power is being charged to scheduling coordinators who are largely unaware of the caisos surreptitious transactions this sweetheart deal violates the caiso tariff which requires the caiso to buy energy from its supplemental energy realtime auction first caiso tariff dispatch protocol section d only after the caiso has used up the supplemental energy bids can the caiso buy out of market oom energy if the caiso were following the tariff cdwrs excess energy would be treated as an uninstructed deviation and cdwr would be paid the clearing price for supplemental energywhich is often as low as therefore under the tariff the caiso could have paid cdwr the same price paid to other scs but instead is buying it at a price agreeable to cdwr by ignoring supplemental energy bids in favor of cdwr power the caiso is able to manipulate the price it pays for energy in the supplemental energy market low caiso demand for supplemental energy drives down prices the clearing price for supplemental energy has often been as low as therefore the caiso gets to keep all excess energy on the grid for free if cdwr was not getting preferential treatment its energy would be treated as excess energy and it would get little or nothing for it while there is no evidence that gov davis has directed the caiso to buy from cdwr first this behavior clearly benefits davis absent the caisos purchases of cdwrs excess energy cdwr would be forced to sell its energy at a huge loss in the open market just like many other suppliers the media has been been making hay out of daviss strategy of buying high and selling low therefore davis and cdwr benefit by being able to offset some of their losses under the longterm contracts of course they are only able to offset their losses through a backdoor deal with the caiso the costs of this expensive cdwr power are being passed through to unwitting scheduling coordinators who frequently seeing minute ex post prices of expect that the cost of imbalance energy will be close to these scs are in for a big surprise according to one source at sierra pacific the caiso charged him as much as mwh for imbalance energy where is the price mitigation here who benefits under this scam davis and cdwr who loses under this scam instate generators who are currently obligated to sell to the caiso scheduling coordinators who overgenerate or that have negative imbalances consumers who end up paying higher prices for energy sources our client representative from the caiso has confirmed this practice and the friday burrito an industry insider publication mentioned it also here is the quote from the friday burritothere is another problem that is being introduced by the longterm contracts the iso is utilizing the dwr contracts as out of market oom calls thereby forcing the contract energy into the grid ahead of the supplemental energy bids in the balancing energy ex post beep market as one of our faithful observers told me the iso will be billing some drwcers longterm contracts to scs as oom energy this has been confirmed by the iso this means there is no realtime price transparency we may see an hourly expost price of say but this will bear no resemblance to the eventual realtime settlement price there is no way to estimate what the oom charge was as the iso doesnt post that information the implication is that parties buying realtime energy will wait days before theyhave any idea of the price this sort of price uncertainty is completely contrary to the fercs

brought this scam to my attention original messagefrom blair kit sent thursday august pmto hall steve c legalcc dlportland volume mgmtsubject revelationsteve here is a summary of what we have learned regarding how the caiso is handling kent at sierra power inquired to me why he was being charged is the charge code the caiso uses when it has to go out of market and purchase power that exceeds mwh is the charge code they use to credit it back for the same hours and intervals that both the inc and dec prices were zero this was obviously very peculiar and nobody in vm knew the answer so caroline posed the question to keoni at the caiso his response was this that the caiso is charging regardless of the inc and dec prices to cover the forward market contracts signed by cdwr and cers in effect they are ignoring their tariff that states they are supposed to purchase power at the lowest price and are in effect trying to recover costs for cdwr and cers kit

sacramento and wash dc that impacts thedecision about edison that i really need an opportunity to bring you andrichard up to speed that cannot happen during a full committee callthere have been several separate conference calls organized by reliant toadvocate the involuntary petition which is i think fraught with legaleconomic and political peril especially sanctions damages etc becausethe claims are subject to bona fide dispute by and large as you knowmost others dynergy duke etc seem to agree with me on the involuntarythe cal legislature is pushing hard on a bill now supported by gov davisand edison that specifically refuses to fund repayment of the energysellers claims while paying the banks and qfs we need a measured andprompt message to deliver to the gov edison and legisl before they pass abill that calls for financing other claims that may not happen even at thelower number without sellers claims if the consequences are that the cloudof an involuntary or litigation or arbitration will scare the underwritersof the bonds away in any eventof course some could argue that the gov legisl and edison are doing thison purpose to provoke the involuntary or litigation so that when edison goesinto chapter they can say the blood is on the gouging sellers hands noton theirs or that may be giving all those d students more credit thanthey deserve i dont knowplease forward this

possibleimplications of making a demand as it would bear on the ferc proceedingsactions by individual participants and possible bankruptcy he also wasntsure whether he supported current committee counsel leading the charge butno firm thoughts on that point he also was not inclined to draw the linein the sand until he saw what comes out of the legislature richard seemsto have some overarching concerns about overlawyering which i suppose areunderstandable given the number of counsel that just enron is supportingwe obviously need to consider how the committee discharges its fiduciaryduties in the most efficient and cost effective manner i richards pointis that there are a bunch of other lawyers who already are actively involvedin things i guess we need to consider whether the committee

px ::::::>>>>>> fwd re proposal re calpx methodologies richard howard seems to acknowledge that the ferc proceedings could themse lves within several months could bring us to the point of knowing the amo unt of our claim against pge even without the benefit of the formula sugges ted by wegs proposal that raises the question of what we get from the we g settlement although he has not specifically articulated the benefits h oward would tell you that his settlement would avoid the cost of litigating the splits would avoid the delay attendant to inevitable challenges of a contested ferc order and would get our collateral back sooner rather than l ater im still not entirely clear about the procedure he intends to adopt to get his deal done and whether there are potential impediments he has characterized the deal as a bankruptcy compromise between px the debtor a nd the participants if all the participants go along that characterizati on is ok if some participants mirantsce oppose the only way you can b ind them to the deal in the px bankruptcy is through a reorganization plan and that itself will take time weg seems to think that most participants will go along im sure edison would oppose although they arent a favo red party in the px case they could have the ability to stymie a settlemen t next the settlement also impacts pge and its bankruptcy if pge doesn t go along it can argue that its bankruptcy court has jurisdiction to fix the claims against pge not the px bankruptcy court then the settlement needs to be presented to and adopted by fercagain an opportunity for par ties to object these procedural hurdles may not have to be dealt with bu t ive received no good exposition of how they would be if they in fact mat erialize are you comfortable proceeding on the

order required judge birchman to make findings about the exact amounts owed by each buyer to each seller the proposal to establish methodologies does exactly that among other things therefore it seems to me that it needs to be part of the the pending california proceedings that is not to say however that it should not also be part of the chargeback proceedings under the april ferc order it should also be applicable to those proceedings therefore we need to develop a strategy to make it part of both proceedings timing is obviously critical and i am soliciting the chargeback movants views on that subject along with the substance of the proposal i would like to point out that i have learned from the settlemen t proceedings before judge wagner that we must submit the proposal early in the

px ::::::>>>>>> pge claim for caiso underscheduling penalty revenues lisahere is the information you requested on our claim against pge for the california iso underscheduling penaltyoverview of the penalty the iso assesses a penaltyknown as charge type against scheduling coordinators whose actual demand exceeds scheduled demand by more than you can find this in the iso tariff at section the tariff also provides that the underscheduling penalty will be distributed to scs whose actual demand exceeds scheduled demand by less than a iso tariff section underscheduling penalty revenues are distributed as charge type here is a handout from the iso explaining the charge procedural background on december the iso filed a tariff change with ferc in which the iso proposed a penalty that would be assessed against scheduling coordinators that underscheduled load ie actual demand exceeded scheduled demand this amendment was adopted by ferc in its december order in march the iso filed tariff amendment asking that the underscheduling penalty be suspended the iso noted that in its transmittal letter accompanying its filing that most of the shortfall in the amount of forward scheduled load is attributable to pge and sce from january to march the iso estimates that the penalties will exceed million page transmittal letter for amendment to the iso tariff submitted to ferc on march ferc rejected the isos request to suspend the penalty and so the iso reluctantly calculated the amounts that would be due to each scthe iso has informed us that we are due million here is the spreadsheet the iso sent us and this is the letter regarding pge claims that accompanied this spreadsheet unfortunately the caisos information does not show us how much of the amount is attributable to pge i called the caiso this morning and was told that others have been requesting this breakout of information the isos response was that it would be impossible for it to determine how much of the pxs penalty was attributable to pgeand therefore it was not going to rerun the settlements i told them that the px only scheduled power for days while the penalty was in effect and that we would still be interested in seeing what pge owed for the period of january to present they are taking this under consideration and promised to get back to me but i am not holding my breathi would phrase the claim in this manner the iso is obligated under its tariff to assess underscheduling penalties to scs underscheduling load by more than the iso filed papers with ferc in march stating that underscheduling penalties had already reached approximately million and most of that amount was due from pge and sce to assist scs in preparing claims against pge the caiso provided epmi with a statement showing that we are due million in underscheduling penalty revenues while pge may not owe epmi the full million based on the isos assertions to ferc on march that pge and sce were responsible for most of the penalties it is almost certain that pges obligations constitute a large proportion of the amount epmi does not have enough information regarding pges meter data to calculate with precision the amount of underscheduling penalty revenues owing from pge as of today the iso has not released information regarding pges liability on this matter to epmi because pge does have this information it is appropriate for epmi to submit a claim for million and let pgewhich has the necessary informationprovide any evidence it has to show that it owes less than millonrichard may have a better suggestion about how to frame no abovei hope this helps ill be back in the office monday if you have any questions im at steve

recruiting ::::::>>>>>> additional references this sounds a lot better i will call walt pollock forwarded by sheila tweedhouect on am alarsenaolcom on pmto sheilatweedenroncomcc subject additional referenceshello sheilai am surprised that the people whom i listed did not speak abouttransactional work i suspect that part of it is that they tend to rememberthings we first did togetherfirst impressions are most readily recalledtherefore this time i will give some notes to accompany the names to helpyou jog their memories about things we worked on togetherfirst i would like you to talk again to fergus pilon at columbia river pudask him about the coastal corporation transactions that involved theirbiggest industrial customer who announced that they either wanted off thesystem or wanted a sweetheart deal i helped the pud call the customersbluff and then we negotiated a mutually beneficial longterm power purchaseagreement that transaction had a regulatory piece to it in that we had toset out the boundaries on the flexibility available to the industrialcustomer before we could negotiate from a position of relative strengthbut it was much more of a deal negotiation in that we put together a powersupply arrangement for the customer that was unlike anything either party hadever done instead of cramming a short term victory through and creating anenemy that would leave the utility as soon as it was possiblewhich couldhave been in a few years the crux of the deal was putting together thecontract i am sure this is very similar to a lot of the ena originationwork being done out of portlandnext ask fergus about the work i did for them on the iron carbide project this was a proposed project that never came about it would have brought ina new large industrial customer to the utilitys system we drafted an moubetween the industrial customer the utility and the developer for an epcproject and then fleshed it out with project documents ownershipagreement om agreement etc the project fell apart when the customerchanged its mind about building the new processing plant but we spent asignificant amount of time creating the business terms for a deal andputting it all into contract formnext i suggest you talk to walt pollock at portland general i imagine youat least know who walt is initially he might also think of some of ourearlier regulatory work but ask him about the following the wppssnegotiation the impetus for this was a massive lawsuit but the solutionwas a transaction that we put together it was a creative arrangementsubstituting phantom generating projects for real but dead projects andsupplying the physical power when called upon with bpa system power andthe rest of the time doing an imaginary power supply that was really afinancial swap that offset the price that various parties paid again wehad to analyze preexisting contracts the law and the regulatory frameworkin which all the parties operated but the crux of this matter was a seriesof very complicated contracts creating both physical and financialtransactionsalso ask walt about the transmission contracts we negotiated on behalf ofbpas large generating customers bpa wanted to and historically haddictated terms for access to and use of the bpa transmission facilitiesutilities that had some of their own generation that they wanted to put ontothe grid had to deal with bpa which viewed them as competitors more thancustomers although they were both i played on the customer roll and thefact that bpa would eventually lose them as customers if it persisted in itsimperious conduct in order to negotiate the terms of transmission contractsin that other role as competitors again there was certainly a regulatoryaspect to this whole matter but it was essentially a transactional mattercaptured in contracts with bpa and leading to the second shoe fallinginthe form of the generating project development and sales that the utilitycustomers then were able to undertake and which i helped to negotiate at thesame timenext contact loren baker president of power resource managers thave ne suite bellevue washington phone iworked for prm on a proposed package of generating resources that were beingdeveloped on behalf of a consortium of utilities depending on the ultimatelevel of demand the package was going to include a number of differentgenerating projects i drafted the mou among the utilities the prospectivedevelopers something like different developers at various times narrowingto at the point that negotiations got serious i then drafted ownershipagreements om agreements etc for the various proposed projects theseprojects were not developed ultimately because a critical mass of theutility sponsors dropped out of the packageprobably more than for any single client i did project development work forthe eugene water electric board i could give you the name of the projectdevelopment manager there and he would give me a glowing recommendation iwould rather not do that however because eweb is still very close to larrycable and i would rather that at this point our conversations not get backto himas would certainly be the case if you contacted anyone at

sempra ::::::>>>>>> re sempra litigationconversation with michael goldstein i spoke with george today about whether enron would be amenable to discussing settlement with sempra and putting the facilities to work on a going forward basis while continuing the fight over past breaches george said that we would be interested but this interest was subject to the following general caveats we would like the facilities moved to one of the sites we are currently trying to get permitted which would be more convenient for us and we want to renegotiate certain portions of the contracts to reflect todays market situation for example the current risk apportionment and price would have to be modified with that in mind do you have any thoughts about the most effective way to facilitate these discussions the last settlement effort was pretty useless and i think we should try to avoid having holmes and gittomer sitting opposite from george and wayne with goldstein and i in the background looking for cover what do you think about a mediation or otherwise getting a third party involved in the alternative would it be a good idea to involve you and mel on a slightly related note i agree that we probably need to get a mitigation letter out but i dont necessarily want to send the one we had been discussing perhaps something that makes clear that they have a continuing duty to mitigate and then discusses getting together to try to resolve things can you take a shot at it and get back to me thanks in advance from brownfeld gail sent tuesday may amto mcclellan george gregory a markel email mcgowan kevin reck daniel arnold matthew gresham waynecc sanders richardsubject sempra litigationconversation with michael goldstein michael goldstein called this morning to discuss the way forward in light of the rev proc and its recent amendment after apologizing for being tardy in returning my calls he explained that in his opinion the tax advice that we received evidences a fundamental misunderstanding of the situation first he stated that he has been advised that the rev proc does not apply retroactively and that although it requires a new plr to make changes going forward it will have no impact on activities which occurred prior to its issuance and therefore has no impact on whether synfuel created before the rev proc qualifies for the tax credit he also noted that to determine the capacity issue one needs to look at what could have been produced by the facilities as of the in service date this level of capacity is the benchmark for what can be produced according to goldstein the level of production at somerset was well below the capacity on the inservice date and therefore their proposed modifications to the facilities would not have increased the capacity in any way inconsistent with the intent of the rev proc when asked what he believed to be the rated capacity of the facilities on their inservice date michael didnt know he has agreed to find this number and get back to me after i explained my understanding of the effect of the rev proc michael kindly suggested that we consider talking to price monford sp at ve who he considers to be one of the inner circle of tax experts familiar with section and the discussions with the service and the treasury department about it i told him that we had consulted with our own experts and i didnt know if this fellow was one of them he said that he had not talked to price and had no idea what he would advise goldstein stated on several occasions that he thought the rev proc would serve as a great facilitator to get the parties talking again in order to mitigate damages he stated further that he was actually looking forward to teeing up the remaining machine at pier ix and even moving the second machine back to virginia when asked what was happening with the machine at pier ix he indicated that it remains idle because they cant get a source of coal for it i told goldstein that i would visit with the coal guys about whether there was a way that we could continue to work together in light of everything that has happened he said that he didnt think this was going to be a problem since once things were up and running there wouldnt be much occasion for the parties to have sufficient contact to yield a problem i suggested that if there was a way forward we needed to make sure the parties were on the same page about the production test coal size etc and even suggested a modified dispute resolution process should issues arise during the course of performance i think that sempra is amenable to an trying to reach an agreement going forward but i expect that absent a mediation or something extraordinary we will end up fighting about november through the date of any deal going forward please note that i made clear that i had no idea whether enron wanted to have anything to do with sempra on this deal outside the courthouse but that i would inquire i told him my personal view was that no matter how strong we felt our case was i would always listen to a settlement plan if they had one finally i told him id get with you guys and call him

sempra ::::::>>>>>> re rw beck depos i expect that if mel didnt examine these witnesses in their depositions that they will certainly be called at trial also their testimony is consistent with michael goldsteins comments to me that i didnt understand the implications of the ruling on these facilities personally i think that plattes testimony that he didnt officially certify the capacity of the machines in and therefore their capacity is unknown is sort of contrived and madeup sounding in light of the rev procand the miracle of hindsight the sempra representations to the irs that the proposed changes would significantly increase production probably didnt mean increase it from to tons per hour also coston is going to have to explain what he meant when he made his representations to the irs and i dont think hes going to lie under oath maybe im naive regardless of the preceding comments it sounds like we probably need to talk to tim w about these issues and also probably need to talk to the km folks through their lawyer about this before the next round of depos on a related note i spoke with michael goldstein on tuesday about several issues first i told him that if they were interested we were interested in sitting down and talking about resolving things going forward i questioned whether they would have an open mind toward issues like moving the equipment he said that this would be up to mr holmes but that he strongly doubted that repricing the deal or dramatically changing the economics of the deal would be acceptable i also asked whether he thought a mediation would be acceptable in response he indicated that although he wouldnt rule it out he thought it was premature finally i mentioned that there had been some talk of deposing him he said that his only involvement in the negotiation phase of the project would be in connection with advice to sempra and therefore these communications would be privileged he said he only met the enron folks once before the documents were signed in august and this was supposedly a pretty casual meeting since he was allegedly busy doing other things he also said that he had no involvement with the irs plrs let me know

facilities specifically i deposedkeith platte all day tuesday and deposed lance hardesty wednesday morningthe testimony was generally unfavorable to us in particular i think theyrequire us to rethink our theory that the recent irs rev procs placeslimits on sempras lost tax credit damage claimas you know irs rev proc stated that a facility may berelocated without affecting the availability of the credit if all essentialcomponents of the facility are retained and the production capacity of therelocated facility is not significantly increased at the new location italso stated that one of the conditions for obtaining a o ruling is thatthe treated feedstock is subjected to elevated temperature and pressurethat results in briquettes pellets or an extruded fuel product or thetaxpayer represents that the omission of this procedure will notsignificantly increase the production output of the facility over theremainder of the period during which the o credit is allowable thisrecent ruling from the irs of course was inconsistent with sempras may plr request in which richard coston stated that another consequenceof the use of our emulsion binder is that less pressure is required in thebriquetting phase to produce a synthetic fuel with a significant chemicalchange applying less pressures causes two changes to occur in theproduction process first a smaller percentage of the synthetic fuel willbe in the form of a briquette second output capacity can be significantlyincreasedwe know from the enron agreements that sempra sought to increase thecapacity of the blue grasssomerset facilities combined to tonsyear if one assumes hourday operation for daysyear eachmachine would need to have a tonhour capacity to reach this levelkeith martin told us that the increase in capacity under rev proc should be measured against the capacity of the facility when it wasplaced in service prior to july as i told you a couple of weeksago the sempra offering memo contains a certificate from rw beck that theblue grass and somerset facilities were placed in service on june in those certificates beck certified a capacity for each machineof tonshour which for the machines means a max of tonsyear i concluded from this that because sempras proposal toincrease blue grasssomerset capacity by reducing the briquetting of theoutput had been rejected by rev proc sempra would not be able toclaim tax credits above those that could be produced at tonshour andthat its damage claim would at the very least be capped at that levelkeith platte pronounced platty the lead engineer for beck and the guywho signed the certification poked a big hole in this conclusion platteis very personable particularly for an engineer appears to know his fieldvery well and in my estimation would make an excellent witness for semprashould he be called mel did not question platte regarding capacityplatte did not have a view as to the maximum capacity of the blue grass orenron facilities according to him the engineering procurement andconstruction epc contracts pursuant to which the facilities wereconstructed said that the facilities were designed to operate at tonshour platte said that rw becks job was simply to certify that thefacilities had indeed been constructed by in accordance with the epccontracts meaning that as of that date the facilities had at least thatcapacity did they have a capacity of tonshour on he cannotsay because he was not asked to and did not test that propositioni spent some time with platte establishing that the capacity of a facilitycannot exceed the capacity limit of a particular component piece ofequipment in that facility he generally agreed with this fact and that aslow piece of equipment could act as a bottleneck i then tried toestablish the capacity limits for different pieces of equipmentparticularly the briquetter i got nowhere he fell back on theproposition that if he did not test it he does not know the capacitylimits he said that if i wanted to know the capacity limit of thebriquetter i needed to talk to the briquetter manufacturer at theconclusion of the deposition i decided that that is what i would doi may still do that but after deposing lance hardesty today i am lessconfident that that would be a fruitful course of action hardesty is notnearly as good a witness as platte he has a kind of wimpy limphandshakedufus quality to him the kind of guy who was off in a corner playing witha sliderule when god was handing out personality hardesty is however avery knowledgeable engineer to cut to the chase hardesty weeks agorecertified the blue grass facility as it had been reconstructed back atsomerset using the original somerset design eg no screen before thecrusher as it was designed at norfolk hardesty certified that the bluegrass facility had a capacity today of at least tonshour mostsignificantly i asked hardesty who participated in the certification to walk through an engineering plan of the facility fromjune and to identify all the changes in facility components betweenthen and now there were not many and he believes holmes will have toconfirm that the significant components in the synfuel process themixer the blender and the briquetter are all the same albeit with somemodifications thus sempras argument will be that if those componentswere capable of producing tonshour in may they must have beencapable of doing so in june the date the facility was placed inservicewhat about the modifications i asked hardesty to identify all of themholmes and frank ikerd told him that the paddles and the internal workingsof the mixer were changed somewhat the blender also had replaced someinternal pieces that wore out due to normal use these things do not soundsignificant to me but an engineer or keith martin could convince meotherwise the briquetter is a different story hardesty had earlieradmitted to me that the spacing between the briquetters is one of the thingsthat can affect the percentage of output that results in a briquette thinkof a piece of charcoal because of significant operational problems in thesummer of they kept breaking the briquetters had to be reconfiguredat the direction of the manufacturer komar industries upon thecompletion of these modifications the briquetter rolls could be adjusted toachieve spacing between the rolls of anywhere from to believe itor not i know what this means hardesty said that during his visit tosomerset earlier this month the briquetter was set at spacing and thefacility demonstrated a capacity of tonshour he then ran a capacitytest at spacing and the facility demonstrated a capacity of tonshour i asked him how the capacities over what had been seen in june were achieved and he said certain improvements were made to the chutefeeding the briquetter and various transition points throughout the processso that the material would flow better in avoiding plugging but in juneof we never attempted any sort of a maximum test we merely tested forthe minimum epc requirements of the epc contract to install the facilitywe then walked through each of the improvements in short other than thechanges to the briquetter none of them struck me as the kind of thing thatwould offend the irsfocusing on the briquetter i asked him why it had been set at hesaid that he was told by holmes and ikerd that that was the setting thebriquetter had after the modifications were completed in well needto confirm this i asked him whether he ran a test at the full spacinghe did not according to hardesty we discussed it with richard holmesfrank ikerd and richard coston and for conservatism with regards tomaintaining the irs placedinservice ruling threequarter inch wasselected as a nominal setting for still making briquettes of a similar size as we made on june of and in roughly the same proportion ofbriquettes to nonbriquetted fines in other words sempra will argue tothe irs that while it has been able to increase capacity over the capacityin it has done so without omitting the briquetting requirement of revproc thus sempras most recent plr request will likely retractcostons may statement that the increase in capacity comes at theexpense of briquettingobviously there is still some factual work to be done to see if semprasnew argument holds water for example how do they prove what the percentof briquettes to nonbriquetted fines was in june also we shouldinspect the new facility at somerset with our own engineer we need toretain one so we can draw our own conclusions finally we will need togrill holmes on much of the foregoing because he continues to be the personwith all the relevant knowledgein sum while the beck depositions did not generate good testimony they atleast give us the tools to rework our

sempra ::::::>>>>>> sempra v enron as i think you guys know the sempra case is currently set for trial on october given this weeks events we believe that the trial date may be pushed back a few weeks however the current wisdom is that any delay will be slight in the event you get any questions from anyone about this case i attach a short by my wordy standards summary of the facts and issues in dispute in addition to what is mentioned in the attached summary please note that we have two motions for summary judgment pending the first is a liability motion arguing that the contract is clear on its face and supports our definition of delivery point if granted this motion would dispose of all of the plaintiffs claims result in a liability judgment in favor of enron and leave only enrons damages to be tried the second motion for summary judgment argues that because the plaintiffs never made a claim for the tax credits they allege to have lost and cannot prove that they would not have received them even if enron was in breach of the parties agreement then plaintiffs damage claim is entirely speculative and must be denied finally despite a good bit of effort on our part several meetings and a business related settlement offer made to plaintiffs several months ago the plaintiffs have never responded or made a counter proposal please let me know if there are any questions about the attached thanks

completed in well need to confirm this i asked him whether he ran a test at the full spacing he did not according to hardesty we discussed it with richard holmes frank ikerd and richard coston and for conservatism with regards to maintaining the irs placedinservice ruling threequarter inch was selected as a nominal setting for still making briquettes of a similar size as we made on june of and in roughly the same proportion of briquettes to nonbriquetted fines in other words sempra will argue to the irs that while it has been able to increase capacity over the capacity in it has done so without omitting the briquetting requirement of rev proc thus sempras most recent plr request will likely retract costons may statement that the increase in capacity comes at the expense of briquetting obviously there is still some factual work to be done to see if sempras new argument holds water for example how do they prove what the percent of briquettes to nonbriquetted fines was in june also we should inspect the new facility at somerset with our own engineer we need to retain one so we can draw our own conclusions finally we will need to grill holmes on much of the foregoing because he continues to be the perso n with all the relevant knowledge in sum while the beck depositions did not generate good testimony they at least give us the tools to rework our analysis on the possibility of using rev proc to limit sempras lost tax credit damages please let me know if you have any questions thanks cpj from la guardia where i just landed christopher p johnson brobeck phleger

of weeks and answer any questions original messagefrom johnson christopher p mailtocpjohnsonbrobeckcomsent wednesday july pmto markel gregory acc brownfeld gail zeisler aaron msubject tom mcquades depositiongregtom mcquades deposition was an adventure i spent all day monday preppinghim and i could not get him to say a word when i asked him about theissues re massey he said he remembers talking to massey but he didntdiscuss buying coal from massey mcquade said that his focus was onselling the synfuel output and that matt arnold must have had thediscussions with massey re buying coal massey had an internal memosaying that mcquade referenced a need for a top size because ofsempras plr but mcquade said steadfastly that he knew nothing about theplr never discussed in the context of coal as opposed to synfueland said that matt must have had those discussions in short based on thefact that mcquade wouldnt talk to me i figured this depo would be abreezewhen we got to the depo however mcquade became chatty cathy he had theopportunity to take use one word answers but he routinely felt a need toexpound for the most part it didnt matter because jonathan siegel wastaking the depo and was getting nowhere i kept reminding mcquade duringbreaks to answer and shut up and he kept acknowledging that that was whathe would do once we resumed the depo however he kept falling back intohis habit of saying too much in the afternoon i cut him off at pointsyouve answered that question now wait for the next onemore importantly mcquades testimony regarding massey began to soundevasive to me he was looking back and forth at the internal masseycorrespondence as if a light had gone off in his head but was still sayingthat he didnt discuss purchasing coal the massey stuff is not a big issuein the case and i started fearing that mcquades testimony would make itone eg they read in the massey depo read parts of mcquade and thensay that mcquade lied about it mcquade had one other big screwup aftertestifying all morning that there is no standard distribution within xcoal mcquade said near the end of the day that he told someone in enron innovember that x has x coalduring a break late in the afternoon i asked mcquade what happened with themassey testimony he said that after seeing again the internal massey memowritten by a guy mcquade knows and trusts saying that mcquade referenced aplr and a top size he began to believe that he must have said that tothe massey guy i asked mcquade what he recalled about it he said that hereally didnt recall anything other than that he might have referenced sizehe still didnt think he referenced a plr he then told me that the meetingreferenced in the memo was a dinner meeting hed had a few drinks etc ithen asked mcquade about the size distribution testimony i suggested tohim that might be the an outside limit of x coal in x andmcquade agreedbased upon the foregoing i asked mcquade just a handful of questions whensiegel finished it was we started at i think it is the firsttime i ever asked cleanup questions of my own witness but i didnt wantthis testimony to stand as it was and i was sure that i would not wantmcquade at trial to clean it up then the size distribution testimony wentsmoothly mcquade reiterated his testimony from earlier in the day re themany factors that affect the size distribution within x and that becauseof those factors there can be no standard distribution i then asked whathe meant when he gave the testimony he said that that was the upperlimit and that it was by no means a standard enough said on the issue idropped itre massey i directed mcquades attention to the internal massey memo andasked whether it refreshed his recollection about discussing coal size withmassey mcquade said that because he knows the author of the memo if theauthor says mcquade referenced coal size mcquade must have done somcquade then said that he still doesnt recall any details whatsoever aboutthe discussion having had drinks over dinner etc he also testified thatnotwithstanding the reference to a plr in the memo he still didnt think hereferenced a plr because mcquade doesnt think he even knew about a plrmcquade surmised that the massey guy might have just been assuming that aplr was involvedsiegel then tried to question mcquade again about the massey meeting but hedid nothing but screw up the record mcquade for example testified forthe first time siegel hadnt asked before that hed actually had meetings with massey the second one being with matt arnold and kevinmcgowan while siegel was questioning i started packing up my things as areminder to siegel that mcquade had a flight to catch siegel took thebait and after muddying up the record some more he decided to terminatethe deposition rather than keep mcquade there to learn about his newrecollection siegel said he had no further questions and mcquade and iwere out of the building in secondsbottom line mcquade was a below average to bad witness but he ultimatelydidnt damage our record because mel will likely come back at matt arnoldabout the massey meetings in an effort to clean up what siegel left somuddy we should be prepared for thatcpjchristopher p johnsonbrobeck phleger harrison llp broadwaynew york new york cpjohnsonbrobeckcomthis email message is for the sole use of the intended recipients and may contain

sempra ::::::>>>>>> sempra litigationconversation with michael goldstein michael goldstein called this morning to discuss the way forward in light of the rev proc and its recent amendment after apologizing for being tardy in returning my calls he explained that in his opinion the tax advice that we received evidences a fundamental misunderstanding of the situation first he stated that he has been advised that the rev proc does not apply retroactively and that although it requires a new plr to make changes going forward it will have no impact on activities which occurred prior to its issuance and therefore has no impact on whether synfuel created before the rev proc qualifies for the tax credit he also noted that to determine the capacity issue one needs to look at what could have been produced by the facilities as of the in service date this level of capacity is the benchmark for what can be produced according to goldstein the level of production at somerset was well below the capacity on the inservice date and therefore their proposed modifications to the facilities would not have increased the capacity in any way inconsistent with the intent of the rev proc when asked what he believed to be the rated capacity of the facilities on their inservice date michael didnt know he has agreed to find this number and get back to me after i explained my understanding of the effect of the rev proc michael kindly suggested that we consider talking to price monford sp at ve who he considers to be one of the inner circle of tax experts familiar with section and the discussions with the service and the treasury department about it i told him that we had consulted with our own experts and i didnt know if this fellow was one of them he said that he had not talked to price and had no idea what he would advise goldstein stated on several occasions that he thought the rev proc would serve as a great facilitator to get the parties talking again in order to mitigate damages he stated further that he was actually looking forward to teeing up the remaining machine at pier ix and even moving the second machine back to virginia when asked what was happening with the machine at pier ix he indicated that it remains idle because they cant get a source of coal for it i told goldstein that i would visit with the coal guys about whether there was a way that we could continue to work together in light of everything that has happened he said that he didnt think this was going to be a problem since once things were up and running there wouldnt be much occasion for the parties to have sufficient contact to yield a problem i suggested that if there was a way forward we needed to make sure the parties were on the same page about the production test coal size etc and even suggested a modified dispute resolution process should issues arise during the course of performance i think that sempra is amenable to an trying to reach an agreement going forward but i expect that absent a mediation or something extraordinary we will end up fighting about november through the date of any deal going forward please note that i made clear that i had no idea whether enron wanted to have anything to do with sempra on this deal outside the courthouse but that i would inquire i told him my personal view was that no matter how strong we felt our case was i would always listen to a settlement plan if they had one finally i told him id get with you guys and call him later today or tomorrow so that hed know whether it was worth having any additional discussions please give me call when you get a chance it might be a good idea to set up a call later this afternoon if you are available 
senator_dunn_inv_ ::::::>>>>>> fw draft research memorandum on senator dunn issues fyithanksgary original message from fergus gary s sent monday may pm to michael l kirby email cc molland michael e smith amanda d subject draft research memorandum on senator dunn issues mike here is the draft research memo that amanda prepared on some of the questions surrounding senator dunns investigation some of this you saw before legislative committee subpoena power government code section provides that a subpoena requiring the attendance of any witness before the senate assembly or a committee may be issued by the president of the senate speaker of the assembly or the chairman of any committee before whom the attendance of the witness is desired if permission has been secured from the rules committee of the respective house there is a relative dearth of case law interpreting govt code et seq and the govt code reporters cross reference to the code of civil procedure sections on issuance of subpoenas ccp et seq therefore it is possible that the provisions of both the govt code and the ccp will govern the issuance and enforceability of a subpoena issued by a legislative committee govt code section provides that a subpoena is sufficient if it a states whether the proceeding is before the senate assembly or a committee b is addressed to the witness presumably the custodian of records when documents are sought c requires the attendance of the witness at a time and place certain and d is signed by the president of the senate speaker of the assembly or chairman of the committee before whom attendance of the witness is desired if the witness does not appear or refuses to testify or neglects or refuses to produce upon reasonable notice any material and proper books papers or document sin his possession or under his control he has committed a contempt govt code section if the contempt is committed while the legislature is in session govt code section provides that the committee shall report the contempt to the senate or assembly for such action as may be deemed necessary by the senate or assembly if the legislature is not in session the superior court in and for the county in which any inquiry investigation hearing or proceeding is held may compel the production of books papers documents and accounts as required by the subpoena issued by the committee on the filing by the committee of a petition to the court asking that the witness be so compelled govt code section provides that any witness neglecting or refusing to attend in obedience to subpoena may be arrested it is unclear how this provision would or whether it could be applied to a subpoena issued to the custodian of records of a nonresident company motion to quash subpoena california courts have held under ccp section that a motion to quash is the procedurally appropriate method of testing the validity of a subpoena duces tecum see eg people ex rel dept of public works v younger calappd my research has revealed no case in which a subpoena issued by a legislative committee has been challenged by a motion to quash but as noted above there appear to be only a very few cases interpreting govt code et seq therefore it appears that a superior court may be able to grant a motion to quash a subpoena issued by a legislative committee assuming that we want to take the risk of state court jurisdiction in one early case the court of appeal held that the contempt order and accompanying affidavit issued by the court upon the request of a senate committee were fatally defective ex parte mclain calappd in mclain the senate interim committee on social welfare served upon mr mclain the chairman of the board of trustees of a corporation a subpoena calling for the production of various books papers and documents mr mclain appeared before the committee but refused to answer questions or produce the documents upon representation of the committee the superior court issued an order directing mr mclain to produce the documents mr mclain again appeared before the committee and again refused to produce the documents at which point an affidavit was filed in superior court stating that based upon evidence in its possession the said senate interim committee has determined that each of the books papers and documents specified in said subpoena duces tecum is material to the matters now under investigation by the said senate interim committee and the production of such books papers and documents is necessary in order to enable said senate interim committee properly to perform the duties imposed upon it and to report to the senate of the state of california pursuant to said senate resolution no and that each of the books papers and documents specified in said subpoena duces tecum is material to the matters now under investigation by the said senate interim committee and that the production of such books papers and documents is necessary in order to enable said senate interim committee properly to perform the duties imposed upon it and to report to the senate of the state of california pursuant to said senate resolution no the superior court found mr mclain guilty of contempt and ordered him committed to the sheriff until he produced the records the court of appeals found that the order and affidavit were defective because a witness who is otherwise orderly and respectful cannot be adjudged guilty of contempt unless the order affirmatively sets forth the materiality and pertinency of the books and papers called for in cases of constructive contempt as is this not only the order but also the affidavit upon which it is based must sufficiently charge the alleged facts constituting the offense mclain at this holding appears to be somewhat consistent with cases interpreting ccp which hold that the subpoena and affidavits must allege material facts rather than conclusory statements see eg grannis v board of medical examiners calappd however cases interpreting ccp also require the subpoena to demonstrate a level of specificity materiality and relevance to be held proper see eg pacific auto ins co v superior court calappd it is unclear whether subpoenas issued by legislative committees are held to this same standard what is the likely impact of a legislative committee subpoena issued against the enron custodian of records an outofstate resident intended to affect the production of outofstate enron documents here are the threshold questions a since we have found so few cases interpreting govt code section to what extent would a legislative committee subpoena be governed by the same procedural and substantive rules as a subpoena issued in a pending civil state court action b would a court determining the validity of a legislative committee subpoena make reference to the code of civil procedure sections governing subpoenas generally ie ccp et seq or those governing deposition subpoenas ie ccp et seq this is a tossup and the answer may well be both the government code reporter sections on legislative subpoenas cross references to ccp et seq subpoenas generally however the deposition subpoena provisions ccp et seq more closely resemble the discovery process that the senator seems to be undertaking subpoenas against outofstate residents under ccp et seq ccp is entitled residency requirements for attendance of witnesses and provides that a witness including a witness specified in subdivision b of section is not obliged to attend as a witness before any court judge justice or any other officer unless the witness is a resident within the state at the time of service there is a statutory limitation on the residency requirement imposed by section section provides when a subpoena duchess mecum is served upon a custodian of records or other qualified witness as provided in article commencing with section of chapter of division of the evidence code and his personal attendance is not required by the terms of the subpoena section shall not apply evade code lays out the terms for compliance with a subpoena for business records where the business is neither a party nor the place where any cause of action is alleged to have arisen on commentator noted the following with respect to ccp the rule limiting subpoenas to california residents ccp does not apply to subpoenas duchess mecum served on custodians of records unless their personal attendance is required see ccp amoco chem co v certain underwriters at lloyds of london calappth fn thus a nonresident custodian of business records may be required to respond to a subpoena duces tecum served upon him or her while present in california by producing the records in accordance with cal evid code delivering copies of the records and accompanying affidavit to the court clerk however ccp probably applies only where the nonresident custodian is employed by a business entity subject to california jurisdiction otherwise there would be no way for the court to enforce compliance with a subpoena served on a nonresident see amoco chem co v certain underwriters at lloyds of london supra werner fairbanks epstein rutter group california practice guide civil procedure trials at moreover in one unpublished case allee v king calappd the court held that it lacked power to compel a nonresident defendant to produce original outofstate documents at trial in so holding the court stated that even though king apparently voluntarily attended the trial his presence does not confer jurisdiction on the court to oblige him to deliver the outofstate documents although section uses the word witness and does not refer to documents it has long been presumed under common law that documents in other states are outside the courts territorial jurisdiction so that a court will allow the use of copies or other secondary evidence instead of originals see eg heinz v heinz calappd pd and cases cited therein the recognition that outofstate documents are not subject to the courts process is in conformity with the general rule under common law that absent a statute properly conferring broader powers the extent of a states subpoena power and its accompanying subpoena duces tecum power is coterminous with its borders see cjs witnesses s p s p s p amjurd witnesses s p s p however the allee court notes that the stateborder limitation on subpoena power has not been extended to local branches of national corporations who are subpoenaed to deliver documents which are outofstate therefore even under allee if a subpoena was issued to a california enron entity that possessed responsive documents that enron entity may be obligated to respond see boal v price waterhouse co calappd therefore if a subpoena is issued which requires the attendance of an outofstate officer of enron enron has a very good argument that that witness is not obligated to attend under ccp it also seems probable that under amoco and allele cited above if a subpoena is served on an enron custodian of records who is employed by a noncalifornia enron entity the subpoena may be invalid however if a subpoena seeking the production of documents is served on the custodian of records or someone similarly situated who is employed by an enron entity that possesses responsive documents and is subject to personal jurisdiction in california that enron entity most likely is obligated to produce the documents it is an open question whether that custodian of records employed by an enron entity in california would only be required to produce the enron documents in the possession of the enron california entity or whether that persons obligation would extend further to produce outof state documents ie documents from noncalifornia enron entities this question is addressed somewhat in the commentary on the ccp statutory scheme see below but is still open subpoenas against outofstate residents under ccp et seq additional threshold question if the legislative subpoena was treated as a deposition subpoena would a court deciding the enforceability of a legislative subpoena treat enron as a party or as a nonparty the rules governing the reach of discovery in california are obviously different for the two the deposition of a party or partyaffiliated witness may be noticed without a subpoena for a place within miles of the witness residence it is unclear how a court would resolve this issue after all if a court was resolving the issue at all an enron entity will have appeared before it and would be a party however it seems moderately more likely that the court would treat enrons obligations under the legislative committee subpoena as similar to its obligations if it was served with a nonparty subpoena there are three types of deposition subpoena a testimony only subpoena requires only the attendance and testimony of the witness a business records subpoena requires only the production of business records and a records and testimony subpoena requires both also formerly called subpoena duces tecum the second of these is the most relevant to enron the attendance of an non party outofstate witness or the production of documents can be compelled only under the law of the place where the deposition is to be taken ccp b specifically ccp b provides if the deponent is not a party to the action or an officer director managing agent or employee of a party a party serving a deposition notice under this section shall use any process and procedures required and available under the laws of the state territory or insular possession where the deposition is to be taken to compel the deponent to attend and to testify as well as to produce any document or tangible thing for inspection copying and any related activity some states issue subpoenas routinely some require a showing of materiality or relevancy and some require a commission from the court where the action is pending this question will depend on the law of the state when the custodian of records resides regarding the question of whether the service of a deposition subpoena on an instate custodian of records would compel the production of outofstate documents weil brown rutter group california practice guide civil procedure before trial at notes it is unclear whether service of a business records subpoena on a nonparty corporation in california compels production of its records located outside the state ccp d requires that the subpoena be directed to the records custodian or someone authorized to certify the records whether custodian requires actual custody of the records is unclear if it does serving an officer or agent in california would not compel production of business records located elsewhere the result is different where a records and testimony subpoena is used that procedure extends to records in control of the subpoenaed party not merely in his or her custody if the state of california files civil suit against enron to obtain discovery of the requested documents does the fact that the state is the plaintiff rather than a private party affect enrons prospects for removal of the suit to federal court if the action filed by the state of california presents a federal question then under the rationale of the court in people of the state of california v steelcase inc cd cal fsupp the case should be removable to federal court in people of the state of california v steelcase inc cd cal fsupp the district attorney of the county of los angeles brought suit alleging violations of the cartwright act and the unfair competition statutes cal bus prof code and the district court found that although the district attorney is only allowed to prosecute cartwright act violations on behalf of the county or public agencies located in the county the unfair competition statutes expressly provide that suit be brought in the name of the people of the state of california id at therefore for the purposes of the unfair competition claims the court found that the state of california was the real party in interest the court then found that for diversity purposes a state is not a citizen of itself therefore it cannot sue or be sued in a diversity action id specifically the court found that even assuming arguendo that defendant is correct that the county of los angeles is the real party in interest and the proper party in the cartwright act claim diversity jurisdiction does not lie because under long established teaching there must be complete diversity ie all plaintiffs must be diverse from defendant eg strawbridge v curtiss us cranch led here there cannot be complete diversity because to repeat the state of california is not a citizen of any state id that independent of its failure to meet the complete diversity test the court lacks jurisdiction over this case because of the bar of the eleventh amendment to the constitution the eleventh amendment is a grant of sovereign immunity to a state against suit in federal court it is in the nature of a jurisdictional bar defendant relying on the literal wording of the eleventh amendment contends that this is not a suit against one of the united states because the state is the plaintiff however since the immunity granted by the eleventh amendment is an immunity from being made an involuntary party to an action in federal court it should apply equally to the case where the state is a plaintiff in an action commenced in state court and the action is removed to federal court by the defendant id internal citations removed however the court noted that where removal is predicated on federal question jurisdiction removal is permitted even where a nonremovable claim is joined with the removable claim id if a criminal case price gouging etc is brought against enron is there any theory preemption primary jurisdiction or double jeopardy which would allow that criminal proceeding to be dismissed stayed or removed given the criminal penalty provisions of the federal power act our preliminary research shows that there is a body of substantive law dealing generally with the question of whether criminal proceedings are subject to the primary jurisdiction doctrine but no case which considered this question with respect to the federal power act specifically generally in one case concerning a district court order staying criminal action involving allegations of conspiracy and fraud against a defense contractor pending the district courts referral of various questions regarding the case to the armed services board of contract appeals the ninth circuit has said our concern with the district courts stay and referral is heightened by the fact that this action is a criminal prosecution while it is true that the primary jurisdiction doctrine has been applied in criminal cases see united states v pacific a ry navigation co us united states v yellow freight sys th cir fd its use clearly interferes with the governments authority to prosecute criminal cases we said in a related context we approach the interpretation of the statute with a presumption against a congressional intention to limit the power of the attorney general to prosecute offenses under the criminal laws of the united states in general the conduct of federal criminal litigation is an executive function within the exclusive prerogative of the attorney general in re subpoena of persico fd d cir quoting united states v cox fd th cir wisdom j concurring congress may limit or reassign the prosecutorial responsibility see case v bowles us sct led nader v saxbe usappdc fd n dccir ftc v guignon fd th cir but to graft such an exception upon the criminal law would require a clear and unambiguous expression of the legislative will united states v morgan us sct led united states v international union of operating engineers local fd th cir cert denied us sct ledd united states v general dynamics corp th cir fd the general dynamics court went on to say that only where an issue unambiguously requires initial agency determination under the primary jurisdiction doctrine and the referring court has the authority to review the agencys order can the agencys regulatory interests be required or allowed to subordinate the governments authority to prosecute criminal offenses id in another context the ninth circuit held that the exhaustion of administrative remedies before the federal election commission was not a prerequisite to indictment under the federal election campaign act neither the language nor the legislative history of the act provides the kind of clear and unambiguous expression of legislative will necessary to support a holding that congress sought to alter the traditionally broad scope of the attorney generals prosecutorial discretion by requiring initial administrative screening of alleged violations of the act on the contrary the language and legislative history indicates that while centralizing and strengthening the authority of the ferc to enforce the act administratively and by civil proceedings congress intended to leave undisturbed the justice departments authority to prosecute criminally a narrow range of aggravated offenses united states v international union of operating engineers local fd see also in re grand jury investigation of shipping industry ddc fsupp though the doctrine of primary jurisdiction may be applied to both civil and to criminal actions it is more forceful in the civil regulatory type actions than in criminal actions for in the latter actions the violations of other federal statutes may more often be involved and the regulatory scheme less affected therefore it seems clear that it will be difficult to invoke the doctrine of primary jurisdiction to dismiss or stay criminal proceedings against enron especially since the criminal penalty provisions of the federal power act are relatively limited in addition at least one court has held in the civil context that the federal power act was not designed to shift the forum for the trial of antitrust questions affecting power companies from the district courts to the power commission fercs predecessor pennsylvania water power co v consolidated gas electric light power co th cir fd i have not been able to find any case directly on point which invokes double jeopardy type arguments in other words if there are possible criminal penalties under the federal power act and the same conduct is at issue that was examined by ferc would state law criminal charges based upon the same conduct be precluded further research on this point after the filing of a criminal claim when the details of the allegations are known may be productive also it may be worthwhile to look for regulatory statutes that consider language similar to that in the federal power act to determine if preemptionprimary jurisdiction case law exists in analogous situationsthis email message is for the

thanks gary original message from fergus gary s sent friday october pm to hymcpuccagov cc mbd subject enron proposals regarding document subpoenas importance high harvey morris esq california public utilities commission public utilities commission san francisco california re i subpoenas served on enron power marketing inc epmi enron energy services operations inc and enron energy services inc collectively referred to as ees enron energy marketing corporation eemc and portland general electric corporation portland generalcollectively sometimes referred to as the enron entities harvey here are our proposals with respect to the enron entities production of documents pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued by the california public utility commission hereinafter the commission the enron entities are willing to assist the commission in undertaking its investigation into the problems in the california electric markets by producing the information specified on a timely basis we believe that the production we propose will enable the commission to commence its investigation much sooner than if the parties were forced to litigate all of the potential objections to the requests for production which are by any standard extremely broad and could involve millions of pages of documents we make these proposals pursuant to our email exchange of october with the understanding that the commission agrees that by cooperating offering to produce or producing documents the enron entities have not waived any objections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoever and that any claims defenses objections jurisdictional or otherwise or other responses have been specifically reserved and can be raised in the future if necessary for all of these proposals we exclude documents that are protected from disclosure by the attorney client and attorney work product privileges generally speaking the enron entities propose to produce documents for year as noted below we also understand that the commission will be obtaining documents from the iso and px and we will not attempt here to duplicate documents that we understand will be produced by those entities as you will see in the general documents that are offered here for production enron energy services operations inc is the parent of enron energy services inc and does not have operating authority or engage in wholesale or retail purchases or sales of energy thus the documents offered here with respect to those two entities originates with enron energy services inc but we have designated them both as ees we also do not propose to offer duplicative documents as between the enron entities general documents requests through because of the dynamic nature of the enron entities businesses the burden and expense on them to locate and produce every corporate organizational chart anywhere in their organizations since april is significant the enron entities will provide the commission with exemplars of their current organizational charts telephone directories and so called family trees to show its current organization to the extent that the enron entities can readily identify and locate exemplars of significant organizational charts telephone directories or so called family trees for earlier periods they will also make those available one enron entity portland general has published books on its corporate history if a list of those books would be helpful we can provide it with respect to the other enron entities to the extent that corporate histories can be found they will be produced we anticipate producing these documents in the first wave on october requests and the enron entities propose that their responses to requests will identify their relationship to affiliated companies and the transaction documents will identify its customers and suppliers we believe this information will be sufficient to illustrate these relationships for the staffs purposes financial documents requests through the enron entities will produce their public filings for the period requested with respect to financial data epmi ees and portland general will provide to the commission electronic transaction data the transaction documents for the purchase and sale of energy delivered which information includes economic data we anticipate producing public filings regarding financial data on october and the electronic transaction documents in the second wave of document productions generating documents requests and for the enron entities other than portland general the generation facilities are either nonexistent or limited in number and there will probably be limited documents available the enron entities to the extent they act as a scheduling coordinator or possessed the right to use or resell generation output do not have the specific documents that pertain to each generation unit requested the enron entities other than portland general do have documents and information for las vegas cogeneration we propose to produce these documents in the second wave of document productions for portland general the production of the requested documents would involve a tremendous volume of documents as portland general owned twenty generating facilities of a variety of types and sizes during portland general is a net importer of energy and can only generate about one half of its total energy demand as a result we question whether the effort required of portland general is warranted as its impact on the california wholesale market is necessarily limited nevertheless portland general proposes to provide for year electronic transaction documents in summary form similar to the data being provided by other enron entities to the extent relevant as discussed below we propose that the commission defer requesting production of other information until it has reviewed the information of generators who sell a significant proportion of their energy into the california market at that time a more accurate assessment can be made of whether this enormous effort will be valuable given the limited impact of portland general generation on the california wholesale market transaction documents requests and we understand that the commission will be obtaining trading data for the purchase and sale of energy delivered in california from the iso and px epmi can provide the commission several different sets of relevant transaction data for year in california and outside of california and real time for the purchase and sale of energy delivered with the date counterparty quantity delivery point hours price and whether it is a purchase or a sale because of the speed with which you want this information it is possible that some entries will be incomplete or inaccurate for those transactions where epmi served only as the scheduling coordinator we understand that the iso will show part of the transaction but there will not be a corresponding transaction in the epmi data we can provide quickly the reason is that this type of transaction is passed through to epmis customer on an accounting system rather than as part of the trading business ees can also provide similar data with respect to relevant wholesale and retail transactions with the proviso that with respect to retail transactions it will not include the specific names of its retail customers but instead will provide a blind customer number due to ees confidentiality obligations to those customers we anticipate producing the transaction documents in the second wave of document productions ferc documents request the enron entities will produce the requests for data they received from ferc and to the extent that ferc has been given responses copies of those responses we anticipate producing the ferc documents on october based upon discussions that we have had with the various enron entities we believe that we could make a second wave of productions on friday october it is possible that not all enron entities could make that date but we believe the bulk of the data could be available for production by then we propose to make these productions with the understanding that if any entity obtains a more stringent protective order than the one currently in place that all of the enron entities document productions will be protected by the most stringent protective order in addition if at the request of any party or nonparty to this proceeding the commission or a court of competent jurisdiction orders that the requests for production be limited reduced or eliminated the enron entities reserve the right to limit the production of documents in conformance with such order we understand that you will consider these proposals and let us know if they are acceptable to the commission if

michael l kirby email cc molland michael e smith amanda d subject draft research memorandum on senator dunn issues mike here is the draft research memo that amanda prepared on some of the questions surrounding senator dunns investigation some of this you saw before legislative committee subpoena power government code section provides that a subpoena requiring the attendance of any witness before the senate assembly or a committee may be issued by the president of the senate speaker of the assembly or the chairman of any committee before whom the attendance of the witness is desired if permission has been secured from the rules committee of the respective house there is a relative dearth of case law interpreting govt code et seq and the govt code reporters cross reference to the code of civil procedure sections on issuance of subpoenas ccp et seq therefore it is possible that the provisions of both the govt code and the ccp will govern the issuance and enforceability of a subpoena issued by a legislative committee govt code section provides that a subpoena is sufficient if it a states whether the proceeding is before the senate assembly or a committee b is addressed to the witness presumably the custodian of records when documents are sought c requires the attendance of the witness at a time and place certain and d is signed by the president of the senate speaker of the assembly or chairman of the committee before whom attendance of the witness is desired if the witness does not appear or refuses to testify or neglects or refuses to produce upon reasonable notice any material and proper books papers or document sin his possession or under his control he has committed a contempt govt code section if the contempt is committed while the legislature is in session govt code section provides that the committee shall report the contempt to the senate or assembly for such action as may be deemed necessary by the senate or assembly if the legislature is not in session the superior court in and for the county in which any inquiry investigation hearing or proceeding is held may compel the production of books papers documents and accounts as required by the subpoena issued by the committee on the filing by the committee of a petition to the court asking that the witness be so compelled govt code section provides that any witness neglecting or refusing to attend in obedience to subpoena may be arrested it is unclear how this provision would or whether it could be applied to a subpoena issued to the custodian of records of a nonresident company motion to quash subpoena california courts have held under ccp section that a motion to quash is the procedurally appropriate method of testing the validity of a subpoena duces tecum see eg people ex rel dept of public works v younger calappd my research has revealed no case in which a subpoena issued by a legislative committee has been challenged by a motion to quash but as noted above there appear to be only a very few cases interpreting govt code et seq therefore it appears that a superior court may be able to grant a motion to quash a subpoena issued by a legislative committee assuming that we want to take the risk of state court jurisdiction in one early case the court of appeal held that the contempt order and accompanying affidavit issued by the court upon the request of a senate committee were fatally defective ex parte mclain calappd in mclain the senate interim committee on social welfare served upon mr mclain the chairman of the board of trustees of a corporation a subpoena calling for the production of various books papers and documents mr mclain appeared before the committee but refused to answer questions or produce the documents upon representation of the committee the superior court issued an order directing mr mclain to produce the documents mr mclain again appeared before the committee and again refused to produce the documents at which point an affidavit was filed in superior court stating that based upon evidence in its possession the said senate interim committee has determined that each of the books papers and documents specified in said subpoena duces tecum is material to the matters now under investigation by the said senate interim committee and the production of such books papers and documents is necessary in order to enable said senate interim committee properly to perform the duties imposed upon it and to report to the senate of the state of california pursuant to said senate resolution no and that each of the books papers and documents specified in said subpoena duces tecum is material to the matters now under investigation by the said senate interim committee and that the production of such books papers and documents is necessary in order to enable said senate interim committee properly to perform the duties imposed upon it and to report to the senate of the state of california pursuant to said senate resolution no the superior court found mr mclain guilty of contempt and ordered him committed to the sheriff until he produced the records the court of appeals found that the order and affidavit were defective because a witness who is otherwise orderly and respectful cannot be adjudged guilty of contempt unless the order affirmatively sets forth the materiality and pertinency of the books and papers called for in cases of constructive contempt as is this not only the order but also the affidavit upon which it is based must sufficiently charge the alleged facts constituting the offense mclain at this holding appears to be somewhat consistent with cases interpreting ccp which hold that the subpoena and affidavits must allege material facts rather than conclusory statements see eg grannis v board of medical examiners calappd however cases interpreting ccp also require the subpoena to demonstrate a level of specificity materiality and relevance to be held proper see eg pacific auto ins co v superior court calappd it is unclear whether subpoenas issued by legislative committees are held to this same standard what is the likely impact of a legislative committee subpoena issued against the enron custodian of records an outofstate resident intended to affect the production of outofstate enron documents here are the threshold questions a since we have found so few cases interpreting govt code section to what extent would a legislative committee subpoena be governed by the same procedural and substantive rules as a subpoena issued in a pending civil state court action b would a court determining the validity of a legislative committee subpoena make reference to the code of civil procedure sections governing subpoenas generally ie ccp et seq or those governing deposition subpoenas ie ccp et seq this is a tossup and the answer may well be both the government code reporter sections on legislative subpoenas cross references to ccp et seq subpoenas generally however the deposition subpoena provisions ccp et seq more closely resemble the discovery process that the senator seems to be undertaking subpoenas against outofstate residents under ccp et seq ccp is entitled residency requirements for attendance of witnesses and provides that a witness including a witness specified in subdivision b of section is not obliged to attend as a witness before any court judge justice or any other officer unless the witness is a resident within the state at the time of service there is a statutory limitation on the residency requirement imposed by section section provides when a subpoena duchess mecum is served upon a custodian of records or other qualified witness as provided in article commencing with section of chapter of division of the evidence code and his personal attendance is not required by the terms of the subpoena section shall not apply evade code lays out the terms for compliance with a subpoena for business records where the business is neither a party nor the place where any cause of action is alleged to have arisen on commentator noted the following with respect to ccp the rule limiting subpoenas to california residents ccp does not apply to subpoenas duchess mecum served on custodians of records unless their personal attendance is required see ccp amoco chem co v certain underwriters at lloyds of london calappth fn thus a nonresident custodian of business records may be required to respond to a subpoena duces tecum served upon him or her while present in california by producing the records in accordance with cal evid code delivering copies of the records and accompanying affidavit to the court clerk however ccp probably applies only where the nonresident custodian is employed by a business entity subject to california jurisdiction otherwise there would be no way for the court to enforce compliance with a subpoena served on a nonresident see amoco chem co v certain underwriters at lloyds of london supra werner fairbanks epstein rutter group california practice guide civil procedure trials at moreover in one unpublished case allee v king calappd the court held that it lacked power to compel a nonresident defendant to produce original outofstate documents at trial in so holding the court stated that even though king apparently voluntarily attended the trial his presence does not confer jurisdiction on the court to oblige him to deliver the outofstate documents although section uses the word witness and does not refer to documents it has long been presumed under common law that documents in other states are outside the courts territorial jurisdiction so that a court will allow the use of copies or other secondary evidence instead of originals see eg heinz v heinz calappd pd and cases cited therein the recognition that outofstate documents are not subject to the courts process is in conformity with the general rule under common law that absent a statute properly conferring broader powers the extent of a states subpoena power and its accompanying subpoena duces tecum power is coterminous with its borders see cjs witnesses s p s p s p amjurd witnesses s p s p however the allee court notes that the stateborder limitation on subpoena power has not been extended to local branches of national corporations who are subpoenaed to deliver documents which are outofstate therefore even under allee if a subpoena was issued to a california enron entity that possessed responsive documents that enron entity may be obligated to respond see boal v price waterhouse co calappd therefore if a subpoena is issued which requires the attendance of an outofstate officer of enron enron has a very good argument that that witness is not obligated to attend under ccp it also seems probable that under amoco and allele cited above if a subpoena is served on an enron custodian of records who is employed by a noncalifornia enron entity the subpoena may be invalid however if a subpoena seeking the production of documents is served on the custodian of records or someone similarly situated who is employed by an enron entity that possesses responsive documents and is subject to personal jurisdiction in california that enron entity most likely is obligated to produce the documents it is an open question whether that custodian of records employed by an enron entity in california would only be required to produce the enron documents in the possession of the enron california entity or whether that persons obligation would extend further to produce outof state documents ie documents from noncalifornia enron entities this question is addressed somewhat in the commentary on the ccp statutory scheme see below but is still open subpoenas against outofstate residents under ccp et seq additional threshold question if the legislative subpoena was treated as a deposition subpoena would a court deciding the enforceability of a legislative subpoena treat enron as a party or as a nonparty the rules governing the reach of discovery in california are obviously different for the two the deposition of a party or partyaffiliated witness may be noticed without a subpoena for a place within miles of the witness residence it is unclear how a court would resolve this issue after all if a court was resolving the issue at all an enron entity will have appeared before it and would be a party however it seems moderately more likely that the court would treat enrons obligations under the legislative committee subpoena as similar to its obligations if it was served with a nonparty subpoena there are three types of deposition subpoena a testimony only subpoena requires only the attendance and testimony of the witness a business records subpoena requires only the production of business records and a records and testimony subpoena requires both also formerly called subpoena duces tecum the second of these is the most relevant to enron the attendance of an non party outofstate witness or the production of documents can be compelled only under the law of the place where the deposition is to be taken ccp b specifically ccp b provides if the deponent is not a party to the action or an officer director managing agent or employee of a party a party serving a deposition notice under this section shall use any process and procedures required and available under the laws of the state territory or insular possession where the deposition is to be taken to compel the deponent to attend and to testify as well as to produce any document or tangible thing for inspection copying and any related activity some states issue subpoenas routinely some require a showing of materiality or relevancy and some require a commission from the court where the action is pending this question will depend on the law of the state when the custodian of records resides regarding the question of whether the service of a deposition subpoena on an instate custodian of records would compel the production of outofstate documents weil brown rutter group california practice guide civil procedure before trial at notes it is unclear whether service of a business records subpoena on a nonparty corporation in california compels production of its records located outside the state ccp d requires that the subpoena be directed to the records custodian or someone authorized to certify the records whether custodian requires actual custody of the records is unclear if it does serving an officer or agent in california would not compel production of business records located elsewhere the result is different where a records and testimony subpoena is used that procedure extends to records in control of the subpoenaed party not merely in his or her custody if the state of california files civil suit against enron to obtain discovery of the requested documents does the fact that the state is the plaintiff rather than a private party affect enrons prospects for removal of the suit to federal court if the action filed by the state of california presents a federal question then under the rationale of the court in people of the state of california v steelcase inc cd cal fsupp the case should be removable to federal court in people of the state of california v steelcase inc cd cal fsupp the district attorney of the county of los angeles brought suit alleging violations of the cartwright act and the unfair competition statutes cal bus prof code and the district court found that although the district attorney is only allowed to prosecute cartwright act violations on behalf of the county or public agencies located in the county the unfair competition statutes expressly provide that suit be brought in the name of the people of the state of california id at therefore for the purposes of the unfair competition claims the court found that the state of california was the real party in interest the court then found that for diversity purposes a state is not a citizen of itself therefore it cannot sue or be sued in a diversity action id specifically the court found that even assuming arguendo that defendant is correct that the county of los angeles is the real party in interest and the proper party in the cartwright act claim diversity jurisdiction does not lie because under long established teaching there must be complete diversity ie all plaintiffs must be diverse from defendant eg strawbridge v curtiss us cranch led here there cannot be complete diversity because to repeat the state of california is not a citizen of any state id that independent of its failure to meet the complete diversity test the court lacks jurisdiction over this case because of the bar of the eleventh amendment to the constitution the eleventh amendment is a grant of sovereign immunity to a state against suit in federal court it is in the nature of a jurisdictional bar defendant relying on the literal wording of the eleventh amendment contends that this is not a suit against one of the united states because the state is the plaintiff however since the immunity granted by the eleventh amendment is an immunity from being made an involuntary party to an action in federal court it should apply equally to the case where the state is a plaintiff in an action commenced in state court and the action is removed to federal court by the defendant id internal citations removed however the court noted that where removal is predicated on federal question jurisdiction removal is permitted even where a nonremovable claim is joined with the removable claim id if a criminal case price gouging etc is brought against enron is there any theory preemption primary jurisdiction or double jeopardy which would allow that criminal proceeding to be dismissed stayed or removed given the criminal penalty provisions of the federal power act our preliminary research shows that there is a body of substantive law dealing generally with the question of whether criminal proceedings are subject to the primary jurisdiction doctrine but no case which considered this question with respect to the federal power act specifically generally in one case concerning a district court order staying criminal action involving allegations of conspiracy and fraud against a defense contractor pending the district courts referral of various questions regarding the case to the armed services board of contract appeals the ninth circuit has said our concern with the district courts stay and referral is heightened by the fact that this action is a criminal prosecution while it is true that the primary jurisdiction doctrine has been applied in criminal cases see united states v pacific a ry navigation co us united states v yellow freight sys th cir fd its use clearly interferes with the governments authority to prosecute criminal cases we said in a related context we approach the interpretation of the statute with a presumption against a congressional intention to limit the power of the attorney general to prosecute offenses under the criminal laws of the united states in general the conduct of federal criminal litigation is an executive function within the exclusive prerogative of the attorney general in re subpoena of persico fd d cir quoting united states v cox fd th cir wisdom j concurring congress may limit or reassign the prosecutorial responsibility see case v bowles us sct led nader v saxbe usappdc fd n dccir ftc v guignon fd th cir but to graft such an exception upon the criminal law would require a clear and unambiguous expression of the legislative will united states v morgan us sct led united states v international union of operating engineers local fd th cir cert denied us sct ledd united states v general dynamics corp th cir fd the general dynamics court went on to say that only where an issue unambiguously requires initial agency determination under the primary jurisdiction doctrine and the referring court has the authority to review the agencys order can the agencys regulatory interests be required or allowed to subordinate the governments authority to prosecute criminal offenses id in another context the ninth circuit held that the exhaustion of administrative remedies before the federal election commission was not a prerequisite to indictment under the federal election campaign act neither the language nor the legislative history of the act provides the kind of clear and unambiguous expression of legislative will necessary to support a holding that congress sought to alter the traditionally broad scope of the attorney generals prosecutorial discretion by requiring initial administrative screening of alleged violations of the act on the contrary the language and legislative history indicates that while centralizing and strengthening the authority of the ferc to enforce the act administratively and by civil proceedings congress intended to leave undisturbed the justice departments authority to prosecute criminally a narrow range of aggravated offenses united states v international union of operating engineers local fd see also in re grand jury investigation of shipping industry ddc fsupp though the doctrine of primary jurisdiction may be applied to both civil and to criminal actions it is more forceful in the civil regulatory type actions than in criminal actions for in the latter actions the violations of other federal statutes may more often be involved and the regulatory scheme less affected therefore it seems clear that it will be difficult to invoke the doctrine of primary jurisdiction to dismiss or stay criminal proceedings against enron especially since the criminal penalty provisions of the federal power act are relatively limited in addition at least one court has held in the civil context that the federal power act was not designed to shift the forum for the trial of antitrust questions affecting power companies from the district courts to the power commission fercs predecessor pennsylvania water power co v consolidated gas electric light power co th cir fd i have not been able to find any case directly on point which invokes double jeopardy type arguments in other words if there are possible criminal penalties under the federal power act and the same conduct is at issue that was examined by ferc would state law criminal charges based upon the same conduct be precluded further research on this point after the filing of a criminal claim when the details of the allegations are known may be productive also it may be worthwhile to look for regulatory statutes that consider language similar to that in the federal power act to determine if preemptionprimary jurisdiction case law exists in analogous situationsthis email message is for the

refused to make the documents available without a court order protecting the confidentiality of the records enron sued july and on thursday sacramento county superior court judge charles c kobayashi granted the companys request for a protective order the judge noted in his order that enron is a business competitor of the california department of water resources which began buying electricity on behalf of the states two largest utilities last january although the committee argues that the senate is not in competition with plaintiff wrote kobayashi the functions of the senate and the department of water resources are intertwined in so many ways that there is no doubt that not only may there be appearances of conflict actual conflicts can arise kobayashis order is a reversal of an earlier tentative ruling in which he concluded that imposing a protective order for enron would be an unacceptable intrusion by the courts into the internal operations of the legislature karen denne a spokeswoman for the houstonbased company described executives as very pleased with the court ruling turning over the documents was never the issue she said the issue was always protecting our rights enron officials will work with committee chairman sen joe dunn dsanta ana to craft an agreement that details which documents will be reviewed by the eight lawmakers and their aides denne said reliant

have to be plugged by the market participants he said on july the senate select committee to investigate price manipulation of the wholesale energy market voted to recommend that enron be cited for

senator_dunn_inv_ ::::::>>>>>> dunn and davis searching for a new scapegoat probing the palace coup electricity a panel focuses on price hikes and the actions of the iso president september by kimberly kindythe orange county register sacramentoa state senate committee is set today to start serving subpoenas on electricity producers and officials who manage californias energy grid to determine whether they acted in concert to manipulate energy prices the investigative committee headed by state sen joe dunn dsanta ana is focusing on a series of events last fall filled with enough shakespearean plot twists and intrigue that it has earned a name around the capitol the palace coup lawmakers and consumer groups allege that the events directed by the man who heads the states energy grid fueled the california energy crisis pushed the state into the powerbuying business and helped make billions of dollars for power producers the central question behind the palace coup is whether terry winter the president of the independent system operator acted alone when he took steps to remove key price caps designed to limit the amount power generators could charge winter defied his own board and gov gray davis when he filed a page request to remove the caps records and interviews show i dont know how these events could have taken place without some concerted effort said dunn the subpoenas will force those involved including winter to provide sworn testimony about the events to the committee and to turn over emails personal calendars and memos davis spokesman steve maviglio said the governor felt betrayed by the actions of winter the governor believes it was the defining moment when what was a mounting problem turned into an instant crisis maviglio said winter refused comment referring all questions to the public relations office iso spokesman gregg fishman said dunns committee will find no criminal conduct the decision was made by iso upper management with one goal in mind to keep the lights on at the time generators were refusing to sell power in california because of the price caps it was an emergency fishman said we had to take action what became known as the palace coup began on oct when iso board members voted for severe restrictions on the amount of money electricity producers could charge for power the restrictions would drive prices as low as per megawatt nearly times below the per megawatt limits of seven months earlier they electricity generators grinned and beared the price cap but this new plan by iso was too much said dunn whose committee has been investigating since march all hell broke loose records show that on oct power generators and electricity traders filed letters with the federal energy regulatory commission demanding that the new plan be killed the letters six in all were sent within two hours of each other and represented dozens of power generators if not removed immediately the iso price cap will sow confusion in the market threaten reliability and stifle new investment in generating capacity read one letter written by duke energy vice president william hall iii although there is nothing illegal about the generators acting together to lobby against price caps dunn believes the letters and other actions around the same time showed clear coordination among energy officials he said the main aim of the subpoenas will be to determine whether collusion occurred to fix prices which would violate federal trade laws in the oct letters electricity producers told federal officials that if price caps werent removed it would lead to a collapse of the energy market the generators got their way the next day the federal commission killed the new pricing plan what was left in place was a price cap established five months earlier power producers then turned their attention toward killing that cap saying they couldnt make a profit even under these constraints they began to withhold power from california and on dec the iso declared its first stage emergency and braced for blackouts which were narrowly averted what followed the next day is considered by the governor and dunn to be the pivotal moment of the energy crisis winter who in his position as president and chief operating officer of the iso submitted a page emergency request asking federal officials to abolish the price cap final authority over lifting the cap rested with the federal government neither the iso board which had established the price cap nor the governor learned of winters actions until the cap had been removed in fact the attorney who helped draft the emergency request charles robinson was in a meeting with representatives of the governor and iso board members just hours before the filing was made he didnt mention anything about it in retrospect we should have told them robinson said with the price caps gone the generators filed paperwork with federal regulators justifying higher costs the iso staff sat in a meeting with the governors key energy advisers with poker faces not saying a word about something that was going on at the exact same moment maviglio said it was beyond belief that they failed to mention something so significant this action accelerated the utilities move toward bankruptcy and forced the governor to move the state into the powerbuying business prices for electricity jumped from an average of a megawatt to a megawatt within three days iso records show dunn believes the resulting overcharges for electricity exceeded billion robinson said the filing granted two hours after the request helped rather than hurt californians prices he said did not spike as a result instead they followed the skyrocketing price of natural gas which is used to run power plants to generate electricity robinson said the emergency order allowed the iso to secure refunds should overcharges for electricity be proven to federal officials we believe the action we took addressed a severe concern robinson said in our view we did not believe we changed or made worse the financial situation we felt we made it better because it introduced a process for review and refund jan smutneyjones who was the iso board chairman at the time and executive director of a group that represents power generators said winter did not consult him about eliminating the price cap smutneyjones also said he was unaware of anyone in the powergenerating community being consulted terry did this by himself said smutneyjones executive director of the independent energy producers he did what he thought had to be done at the time to keep the power flowing the iso board called an emergency meeting the next week demanding winter explain his actions some board members pushed to have winter removed but there were concerns such action would lead to more chaos the governors spokesman maviglio said james j hoecker the former federal energy regulatory commission chairman defended making the december decision and also defended winter they filed an emergency motion and we were not about to let california go dark hoecker said they iso management did what any independent system operator would do what dunns committee hopes to learn is why all these events transpired he believes memos and emails around the time of winters dec actions should provide vital clues we dont know why he did what he did but we are eager to find out dunn said terry said he made that filing in the interest of californians but i find that argument has no basis in fact 
senator_dunn_inv_ ::::::>>>>>> fw draft research memorandum on senator dunn issues fyithanksgary original message from fergus gary s sent monday may pm to michael l kirby email cc molland michael e smith amanda d subject draft research memorandum on senator dunn issues mike here is the draft research memo that amanda prepared on some of the questions surrounding senator dunns investigation some of this you saw before legislative committee subpoena power government code section provides that a subpoena requiring the attendance of any witness before the senate assembly or a committee may be issued by the president of the senate speaker of the assembly or the chairman of any committee before whom the attendance of the witness is desired if permission has been secured from the rules committee of the respective house there is a relative dearth of case law interpreting govt code et seq and the govt code reporters cross reference to the code of civil procedure sections on issuance of subpoenas ccp et seq therefore it is possible that the provisions of both the govt code and the ccp will govern the issuance and enforceability of a subpoena issued by a legislative committee govt code section provides that a subpoena is sufficient if it a states whether the proceeding is before the senate assembly or a committee b is addressed to the witness presumably the custodian of records when documents are sought c requires the attendance of the witness at a time and place certain and d is signed by the president of the senate speaker of the assembly or chairman of the committee before whom attendance of the witness is desired if the witness does not appear or refuses to testify or neglects or refuses to produce upon reasonable notice any material and proper books papers or document sin his possession or under his control he has committed a contempt govt code section if the contempt is committed while the legislature is in session govt code section provides that the committee shall report the contempt to the senate or assembly for such action as may be deemed necessary by the senate or assembly if the legislature is not in session the superior court in and for the county in which any inquiry investigation hearing or proceeding is held may compel the production of books papers documents and accounts as required by the subpoena issued by the committee on the filing by the committee of a petition to the court asking that the witness be so compelled govt code section provides that any witness neglecting or refusing to attend in obedience to subpoena may be arrested it is unclear how this provision would or whether it could be applied to a subpoena issued to the custodian of records of a nonresident company motion to quash subpoena california courts have held under ccp section that a motion to quash is the procedurally appropriate method of testing the validity of a subpoena duces tecum see eg people ex rel dept of public works v younger calappd my research has revealed no case in which a subpoena issued by a legislative committee has been challenged by a motion to quash but as noted above there appear to be only a very few cases interpreting govt code et seq therefore it appears that a superior court may be able to grant a motion to quash a subpoena issued by a legislative committee assuming that we want to take the risk of state court jurisdiction in one early case the court of appeal held that the contempt order and accompanying affidavit issued by the court upon the request of a senate committee were fatally defective ex parte mclain calappd in mclain the senate interim committee on social welfare served upon mr mclain the chairman of the board of trustees of a corporation a subpoena calling for the production of various books papers and documents mr mclain appeared before the committee but refused to answer questions or produce the documents upon representation of the committee the superior court issued an order directing mr mclain to produce the documents mr mclain again appeared before the committee and again refused to produce the documents at which point an affidavit was filed in superior court stating that based upon evidence in its possession the said senate interim committee has determined that each of the books papers and documents specified in said subpoena duces tecum is material to the matters now under investigation by the said senate interim committee and the production of such books papers and documents is necessary in order to enable said senate interim committee properly to perform the duties imposed upon it and to report to the senate of the state of california pursuant to said senate resolution no and that each of the books papers and documents specified in said subpoena duces tecum is material to the matters now under investigation by the said senate interim committee and that the production of such books papers and documents is necessary in order to enable said senate interim committee properly to perform the duties imposed upon it and to report to the senate of the state of california pursuant to said senate resolution no the superior court found mr mclain guilty of contempt and ordered him committed to the sheriff until he produced the records the court of appeals found that the order and affidavit were defective because a witness who is otherwise orderly and respectful cannot be adjudged guilty of contempt unless the order affirmatively sets forth the materiality and pertinency of the books and papers called for in cases of constructive contempt as is this not only the order but also the affidavit upon which it is based must sufficiently charge the alleged facts constituting the offense mclain at this holding appears to be somewhat consistent with cases interpreting ccp which hold that the subpoena and affidavits must allege material facts rather than conclusory statements see eg grannis v board of medical examiners calappd however cases interpreting ccp also require the subpoena to demonstrate a level of specificity materiality and relevance to be held proper see eg pacific auto ins co v superior court calappd it is unclear whether subpoenas issued by legislative committees are held to this same standard what is the likely impact of a legislative committee subpoena issued against the enron custodian of records an outofstate resident intended to affect the production of outofstate enron documents here are the threshold questions a since we have found so few cases interpreting govt code section to what extent would a legislative committee subpoena be governed by the same procedural and substantive rules as a subpoena issued in a pending civil state court action b would a court determining the validity of a legislative committee subpoena make reference to the code of civil procedure sections governing subpoenas generally ie ccp et seq or those governing deposition subpoenas ie ccp et seq this is a tossup and the answer may well be both the government code reporter sections on legislative subpoenas cross references to ccp et seq subpoenas generally however the deposition subpoena provisions ccp et seq more closely resemble the discovery process that the senator seems to be undertaking subpoenas against outofstate residents under ccp et seq ccp is entitled residency requirements for attendance of witnesses and provides that a witness including a witness specified in subdivision b of section is not obliged to attend as a witness before any court judge justice or any other officer unless the witness is a resident within the state at the time of service there is a statutory limitation on the residency requirement imposed by section section provides when a subpoena duchess mecum is served upon a custodian of records or other qualified witness as provided in article commencing with section of chapter of division of the evidence code and his personal attendance is not required by the terms of the subpoena section shall not apply evade code lays out the terms for compliance with a subpoena for business records where the business is neither a party nor the place where any cause of action is alleged to have arisen on commentator noted the following with respect to ccp the rule limiting subpoenas to california residents ccp does not apply to subpoenas duchess mecum served on custodians of records unless their personal attendance is required see ccp amoco chem co v certain underwriters at lloyds of london calappth fn thus a nonresident custodian of business records may be required to respond to a subpoena duces tecum served upon him or her while present in california by producing the records in accordance with cal evid code delivering copies of the records and accompanying affidavit to the court clerk however ccp probably applies only where the nonresident custodian is employed by a business entity subject to california jurisdiction otherwise there would be no way for the court to enforce compliance with a subpoena served on a nonresident see amoco chem co v certain underwriters at lloyds of london supra werner fairbanks epstein rutter group california practice guide civil procedure trials at moreover in one unpublished case allee v king calappd the court held that it lacked power to compel a nonresident defendant to produce original outofstate documents at trial in so holding the court stated that even though king apparently voluntarily attended the trial his presence does not confer jurisdiction on the court to oblige him to deliver the outofstate documents although section uses the word witness and does not refer to documents it has long been presumed under common law that documents in other states are outside the courts territorial jurisdiction so that a court will allow the use of copies or other secondary evidence instead of originals see eg heinz v heinz calappd pd and cases cited therein the recognition that outofstate documents are not subject to the courts process is in conformity with the general rule under common law that absent a statute properly conferring broader powers the extent of a states subpoena power and its accompanying subpoena duces tecum power is coterminous with its borders see cjs witnesses s p s p s p amjurd witnesses s p s p however the allee court notes that the stateborder limitation on subpoena power has not been extended to local branches of national corporations who are subpoenaed to deliver documents which are outofstate therefore even under allee if a subpoena was issued to a california enron entity that possessed responsive documents that enron entity may be obligated to respond see boal v price waterhouse co calappd therefore if a subpoena is issued which requires the attendance of an outofstate officer of enron enron has a very good argument that that witness is not obligated to attend under ccp it also seems probable that under amoco and allele cited above if a subpoena is served on an enron custodian of records who is employed by a noncalifornia enron entity the subpoena may be invalid however if a subpoena seeking the production of documents is served on the custodian of records or someone similarly situated who is employed by an enron entity that possesses responsive documents and is subject to personal jurisdiction in california that enron entity most likely is obligated to produce the documents it is an open question whether that custodian of records employed by an enron entity in california would only be required to produce the enron documents in the possession of the enron california entity or whether that persons obligation would extend further to produce outof state documents ie documents from noncalifornia enron entities this question is addressed somewhat in the commentary on the ccp statutory scheme see below but is still open subpoenas against outofstate residents under ccp et seq additional threshold question if the legislative subpoena was treated as a deposition subpoena would a court deciding the enforceability of a legislative subpoena treat enron as a party or as a nonparty the rules governing the reach of discovery in california are obviously different for the two the deposition of a party or partyaffiliated witness may be noticed without a subpoena for a place within miles of the witness residence it is unclear how a court would resolve this issue after all if a court was resolving the issue at all an enron entity will have appeared before it and would be a party however it seems moderately more likely that the court would treat enrons obligations under the legislative committee subpoena as similar to its obligations if it was served with a nonparty subpoena there are three types of deposition subpoena a testimony only subpoena requires only the attendance and testimony of the witness a business records subpoena requires only the production of business records and a records and testimony subpoena requires both also formerly called subpoena duces tecum the second of these is the most relevant to enron the attendance of an non party outofstate witness or the production of documents can be compelled only under the law of the place where the deposition is to be taken ccp b specifically ccp b provides if the deponent is not a party to the action or an officer director managing agent or employee of a party a party serving a deposition notice under this section shall use any process and procedures required and available under the laws of the state territory or insular possession where the deposition is to be taken to compel the deponent to attend and to testify as well as to produce any document or tangible thing for inspection copying and any related activity some states issue subpoenas routinely some require a showing of materiality or relevancy and some require a commission from the court where the action is pending this question will depend on the law of the state when the custodian of records resides regarding the question of whether the service of a deposition subpoena on an instate custodian of records would compel the production of outofstate documents weil brown rutter group california practice guide civil procedure before trial at notes it is unclear whether service of a business records subpoena on a nonparty corporation in california compels production of its records located outside the state ccp d requires that the subpoena be directed to the records custodian or someone authorized to certify the records whether custodian requires actual custody of the records is unclear if it does serving an officer or agent in california would not compel production of business records located elsewhere the result is different where a records and testimony subpoena is used that procedure extends to records in control of the subpoenaed party not merely in his or her custody if the state of california files civil suit against enron to obtain discovery of the requested documents does the fact that the state is the plaintiff rather than a private party affect enrons prospects for removal of the suit to federal court if the action filed by the state of california presents a federal question then under the rationale of the court in people of the state of california v steelcase inc cd cal fsupp the case should be removable to federal court in people of the state of california v steelcase inc cd cal fsupp the district attorney of the county of los angeles brought suit alleging violations of the cartwright act and the unfair competition statutes cal bus prof code and the district court found that although the district attorney is only allowed to prosecute cartwright act violations on behalf of the county or public agencies located in the county the unfair competition statutes expressly provide that suit be brought in the name of the people of the state of california id at therefore for the purposes of the unfair competition claims the court found that the state of california was the real party in interest the court then found that for diversity purposes a state is not a citizen of itself therefore it cannot sue or be sued in a diversity action id specifically the court found that even assuming arguendo that defendant is correct that the county of los angeles is the real party in interest and the proper party in the cartwright act claim diversity jurisdiction does not lie because under long established teaching there must be complete diversity ie all plaintiffs must be diverse from defendant eg strawbridge v curtiss us cranch led here there cannot be complete diversity because to repeat the state of california is not a citizen of any state id that independent of its failure to meet the complete diversity test the court lacks jurisdiction over this case because of the bar of the eleventh amendment to the constitution the eleventh amendment is a grant of sovereign immunity to a state against suit in federal court it is in the nature of a jurisdictional bar defendant relying on the literal wording of the eleventh amendment contends that this is not a suit against one of the united states because the state is the plaintiff however since the immunity granted by the eleventh amendment is an immunity from being made an involuntary party to an action in federal court it should apply equally to the case where the state is a plaintiff in an action commenced in state court and the action is removed to federal court by the defendant id internal citations removed however the court noted that where removal is predicated on federal question jurisdiction removal is permitted even where a nonremovable claim is joined with the removable claim id if a criminal case price gouging etc is brought against enron is there any theory preemption primary jurisdiction or double jeopardy which would allow that criminal proceeding to be dismissed stayed or removed given the criminal penalty provisions of the federal power act our preliminary research shows that there is a body of substantive law dealing generally with the question of whether criminal proceedings are subject to the primary jurisdiction doctrine but no case which considered this question with respect to the federal power act specifically generally in one case concerning a district court order staying criminal action involving allegations of conspiracy and fraud against a defense contractor pending the district courts referral of various questions regarding the case to the armed services board of contract appeals the ninth circuit has said our concern with the district courts stay and referral is heightened by the fact that this action is a criminal prosecution while it is true that the primary jurisdiction doctrine has been applied in criminal cases see united states v pacific a ry navigation co us united states v yellow freight sys th cir fd its use clearly interferes with the governments authority to prosecute criminal cases we said in a related context we approach the interpretation of the statute with a presumption against a congressional intention to limit the power of the attorney general to prosecute offenses under the criminal laws of the united states in general the conduct of federal criminal litigation is an executive function within the exclusive prerogative of the attorney general in re subpoena of persico fd d cir quoting united states v cox fd th cir wisdom j concurring congress may limit or reassign the prosecutorial responsibility see case v bowles us sct led nader v saxbe usappdc fd n dccir ftc v guignon fd th cir but to graft such an exception upon the criminal law would require a clear and unambiguous expression of the legislative will united states v morgan us sct led united states v international union of operating engineers local fd th cir cert denied us sct ledd united states v general dynamics corp th cir fd the general dynamics court went on to say that only where an issue unambiguously requires initial agency determination under the primary jurisdiction doctrine and the referring court has the authority to review the agencys order can the agencys regulatory interests be required or allowed to subordinate the governments authority to prosecute criminal offenses id in another context the ninth circuit held that the exhaustion of administrative remedies before the federal election commission was not a prerequisite to indictment under the federal election campaign act neither the language nor the legislative history of the act provides the kind of clear and unambiguous expression of legislative will necessary to support a holding that congress sought to alter the traditionally broad scope of the attorney generals prosecutorial discretion by requiring initial administrative screening of alleged violations of the act on the contrary the language and legislative history indicates that while centralizing and strengthening the authority of the ferc to enforce the act administratively and by civil proceedings congress intended to leave undisturbed the justice departments authority to prosecute criminally a narrow range of aggravated offenses united states v international union of operating engineers local fd see also in re grand jury investigation of shipping industry ddc fsupp though the doctrine of primary jurisdiction may be applied to both civil and to criminal actions it is more forceful in the civil regulatory type actions than in criminal actions for in the latter actions the violations of other federal statutes may more often be involved and the regulatory scheme less affected therefore it seems clear that it will be difficult to invoke the doctrine of primary jurisdiction to dismiss or stay criminal proceedings against enron especially since the criminal penalty provisions of the federal power act are relatively limited in addition at least one court has held in the civil context that the federal power act was not designed to shift the forum for the trial of antitrust questions affecting power companies from the district courts to the power commission fercs predecessor pennsylvania water power co v consolidated gas electric light power co th cir fd i have not been able to find any case directly on point which invokes double jeopardy type arguments in other words if there are possible criminal penalties under the federal power act and the same conduct is at issue that was examined by ferc would state law criminal charges based upon the same conduct be precluded further research on this point after the filing of a criminal claim when the details of the allegations are known may be productive also it may be worthwhile to look for regulatory statutes that consider language similar to that in the federal power act to determine if preemptionprimary jurisdiction case law exists in analogous situationsthis email message is for the

michael l kirby email cc molland michael e smith amanda d subject draft research memorandum on senator dunn issues mike here is the draft research memo that amanda prepared on some of the questions surrounding senator dunns investigation some of this you saw before legislative committee subpoena power government code section provides that a subpoena requiring the attendance of any witness before the senate assembly or a committee may be issued by the president of the senate speaker of the assembly or the chairman of any committee before whom the attendance of the witness is desired if permission has been secured from the rules committee of the respective house there is a relative dearth of case law interpreting govt code et seq and the govt code reporters cross reference to the code of civil procedure sections on issuance of subpoenas ccp et seq therefore it is possible that the provisions of both the govt code and the ccp will govern the issuance and enforceability of a subpoena issued by a legislative committee govt code section provides that a subpoena is sufficient if it a states whether the proceeding is before the senate assembly or a committee b is addressed to the witness presumably the custodian of records when documents are sought c requires the attendance of the witness at a time and place certain and d is signed by the president of the senate speaker of the assembly or chairman of the committee before whom attendance of the witness is desired if the witness does not appear or refuses to testify or neglects or refuses to produce upon reasonable notice any material and proper books papers or document sin his possession or under his control he has committed a contempt govt code section if the contempt is committed while the legislature is in session govt code section provides that the committee shall report the contempt to the senate or assembly for such action as may be deemed necessary by the senate or assembly if the legislature is not in session the superior court in and for the county in which any inquiry investigation hearing or proceeding is held may compel the production of books papers documents and accounts as required by the subpoena issued by the committee on the filing by the committee of a petition to the court asking that the witness be so compelled govt code section provides that any witness neglecting or refusing to attend in obedience to subpoena may be arrested it is unclear how this provision would or whether it could be applied to a subpoena issued to the custodian of records of a nonresident company motion to quash subpoena california courts have held under ccp section that a motion to quash is the procedurally appropriate method of testing the validity of a subpoena duces tecum see eg people ex rel dept of public works v younger calappd my research has revealed no case in which a subpoena issued by a legislative committee has been challenged by a motion to quash but as noted above there appear to be only a very few cases interpreting govt code et seq therefore it appears that a superior court may be able to grant a motion to quash a subpoena issued by a legislative committee assuming that we want to take the risk of state court jurisdiction in one early case the court of appeal held that the contempt order and accompanying affidavit issued by the court upon the request of a senate committee were fatally defective ex parte mclain calappd in mclain the senate interim committee on social welfare served upon mr mclain the chairman of the board of trustees of a corporation a subpoena calling for the production of various books papers and documents mr mclain appeared before the committee but refused to answer questions or produce the documents upon representation of the committee the superior court issued an order directing mr mclain to produce the documents mr mclain again appeared before the committee and again refused to produce the documents at which point an affidavit was filed in superior court stating that based upon evidence in its possession the said senate interim committee has determined that each of the books papers and documents specified in said subpoena duces tecum is material to the matters now under investigation by the said senate interim committee and the production of such books papers and documents is necessary in order to enable said senate interim committee properly to perform the duties imposed upon it and to report to the senate of the state of california pursuant to said senate resolution no and that each of the books papers and documents specified in said subpoena duces tecum is material to the matters now under investigation by the said senate interim committee and that the production of such books papers and documents is necessary in order to enable said senate interim committee properly to perform the duties imposed upon it and to report to the senate of the state of california pursuant to said senate resolution no the superior court found mr mclain guilty of contempt and ordered him committed to the sheriff until he produced the records the court of appeals found that the order and affidavit were defective because a witness who is otherwise orderly and respectful cannot be adjudged guilty of contempt unless the order affirmatively sets forth the materiality and pertinency of the books and papers called for in cases of constructive contempt as is this not only the order but also the affidavit upon which it is based must sufficiently charge the alleged facts constituting the offense mclain at this holding appears to be somewhat consistent with cases interpreting ccp which hold that the subpoena and affidavits must allege material facts rather than conclusory statements see eg grannis v board of medical examiners calappd however cases interpreting ccp also require the subpoena to demonstrate a level of specificity materiality and relevance to be held proper see eg pacific auto ins co v superior court calappd it is unclear whether subpoenas issued by legislative committees are held to this same standard what is the likely impact of a legislative committee subpoena issued against the enron custodian of records an outofstate resident intended to affect the production of outofstate enron documents here are the threshold questions a since we have found so few cases interpreting govt code section to what extent would a legislative committee subpoena be governed by the same procedural and substantive rules as a subpoena issued in a pending civil state court action b would a court determining the validity of a legislative committee subpoena make reference to the code of civil procedure sections governing subpoenas generally ie ccp et seq or those governing deposition subpoenas ie ccp et seq this is a tossup and the answer may well be both the government code reporter sections on legislative subpoenas cross references to ccp et seq subpoenas generally however the deposition subpoena provisions ccp et seq more closely resemble the discovery process that the senator seems to be undertaking subpoenas against outofstate residents under ccp et seq ccp is entitled residency requirements for attendance of witnesses and provides that a witness including a witness specified in subdivision b of section is not obliged to attend as a witness before any court judge justice or any other officer unless the witness is a resident within the state at the time of service there is a statutory limitation on the residency requirement imposed by section section provides when a subpoena duchess mecum is served upon a custodian of records or other qualified witness as provided in article commencing with section of chapter of division of the evidence code and his personal attendance is not required by the terms of the subpoena section shall not apply evade code lays out the terms for compliance with a subpoena for business records where the business is neither a party nor the place where any cause of action is alleged to have arisen on commentator noted the following with respect to ccp the rule limiting subpoenas to california residents ccp does not apply to subpoenas duchess mecum served on custodians of records unless their personal attendance is required see ccp amoco chem co v certain underwriters at lloyds of london calappth fn thus a nonresident custodian of business records may be required to respond to a subpoena duces tecum served upon him or her while present in california by producing the records in accordance with cal evid code delivering copies of the records and accompanying affidavit to the court clerk however ccp probably applies only where the nonresident custodian is employed by a business entity subject to california jurisdiction otherwise there would be no way for the court to enforce compliance with a subpoena served on a nonresident see amoco chem co v certain underwriters at lloyds of london supra werner fairbanks epstein rutter group california practice guide civil procedure trials at moreover in one unpublished case allee v king calappd the court held that it lacked power to compel a nonresident defendant to produce original outofstate documents at trial in so holding the court stated that even though king apparently voluntarily attended the trial his presence does not confer jurisdiction on the court to oblige him to deliver the outofstate documents although section uses the word witness and does not refer to documents it has long been presumed under common law that documents in other states are outside the courts territorial jurisdiction so that a court will allow the use of copies or other secondary evidence instead of originals see eg heinz v heinz calappd pd and cases cited therein the recognition that outofstate documents are not subject to the courts process is in conformity with the general rule under common law that absent a statute properly conferring broader powers the extent of a states subpoena power and its accompanying subpoena duces tecum power is coterminous with its borders see cjs witnesses s p s p s p amjurd witnesses s p s p however the allee court notes that the stateborder limitation on subpoena power has not been extended to local branches of national corporations who are subpoenaed to deliver documents which are outofstate therefore even under allee if a subpoena was issued to a california enron entity that possessed responsive documents that enron entity may be obligated to respond see boal v price waterhouse co calappd therefore if a subpoena is issued which requires the attendance of an outofstate officer of enron enron has a very good argument that that witness is not obligated to attend under ccp it also seems probable that under amoco and allele cited above if a subpoena is served on an enron custodian of records who is employed by a noncalifornia enron entity the subpoena may be invalid however if a subpoena seeking the production of documents is served on the custodian of records or someone similarly situated who is employed by an enron entity that possesses responsive documents and is subject to personal jurisdiction in california that enron entity most likely is obligated to produce the documents it is an open question whether that custodian of records employed by an enron entity in california would only be required to produce the enron documents in the possession of the enron california entity or whether that persons obligation would extend further to produce outof state documents ie documents from noncalifornia enron entities this question is addressed somewhat in the commentary on the ccp statutory scheme see below but is still open subpoenas against outofstate residents under ccp et seq additional threshold question if the legislative subpoena was treated as a deposition subpoena would a court deciding the enforceability of a legislative subpoena treat enron as a party or as a nonparty the rules governing the reach of discovery in california are obviously different for the two the deposition of a party or partyaffiliated witness may be noticed without a subpoena for a place within miles of the witness residence it is unclear how a court would resolve this issue after all if a court was resolving the issue at all an enron entity will have appeared before it and would be a party however it seems moderately more likely that the court would treat enrons obligations under the legislative committee subpoena as similar to its obligations if it was served with a nonparty subpoena there are three types of deposition subpoena a testimony only subpoena requires only the attendance and testimony of the witness a business records subpoena requires only the production of business records and a records and testimony subpoena requires both also formerly called subpoena duces tecum the second of these is the most relevant to enron the attendance of an non party outofstate witness or the production of documents can be compelled only under the law of the place where the deposition is to be taken ccp b specifically ccp b provides if the deponent is not a party to the action or an officer director managing agent or employee of a party a party serving a deposition notice under this section shall use any process and procedures required and available under the laws of the state territory or insular possession where the deposition is to be taken to compel the deponent to attend and to testify as well as to produce any document or tangible thing for inspection copying and any related activity some states issue subpoenas routinely some require a showing of materiality or relevancy and some require a commission from the court where the action is pending this question will depend on the law of the state when the custodian of records resides regarding the question of whether the service of a deposition subpoena on an instate custodian of records would compel the production of outofstate documents weil brown rutter group california practice guide civil procedure before trial at notes it is unclear whether service of a business records subpoena on a nonparty corporation in california compels production of its records located outside the state ccp d requires that the subpoena be directed to the records custodian or someone authorized to certify the records whether custodian requires actual custody of the records is unclear if it does serving an officer or agent in california would not compel production of business records located elsewhere the result is different where a records and testimony subpoena is used that procedure extends to records in control of the subpoenaed party not merely in his or her custody if the state of california files civil suit against enron to obtain discovery of the requested documents does the fact that the state is the plaintiff rather than a private party affect enrons prospects for removal of the suit to federal court if the action filed by the state of california presents a federal question then under the rationale of the court in people of the state of california v steelcase inc cd cal fsupp the case should be removable to federal court in people of the state of california v steelcase inc cd cal fsupp the district attorney of the county of los angeles brought suit alleging violations of the cartwright act and the unfair competition statutes cal bus prof code and the district court found that although the district attorney is only allowed to prosecute cartwright act violations on behalf of the county or public agencies located in the county the unfair competition statutes expressly provide that suit be brought in the name of the people of the state of california id at therefore for the purposes of the unfair competition claims the court found that the state of california was the real party in interest the court then found that for diversity purposes a state is not a citizen of itself therefore it cannot sue or be sued in a diversity action id specifically the court found that even assuming arguendo that defendant is correct that the county of los angeles is the real party in interest and the proper party in the cartwright act claim diversity jurisdiction does not lie because under long established teaching there must be complete diversity ie all plaintiffs must be diverse from defendant eg strawbridge v curtiss us cranch led here there cannot be complete diversity because to repeat the state of california is not a citizen of any state id that independent of its failure to meet the complete diversity test the court lacks jurisdiction over this case because of the bar of the eleventh amendment to the constitution the eleventh amendment is a grant of sovereign immunity to a state against suit in federal court it is in the nature of a jurisdictional bar defendant relying on the literal wording of the eleventh amendment contends that this is not a suit against one of the united states because the state is the plaintiff however since the immunity granted by the eleventh amendment is an immunity from being made an involuntary party to an action in federal court it should apply equally to the case where the state is a plaintiff in an action commenced in state court and the action is removed to federal court by the defendant id internal citations removed however the court noted that where removal is predicated on federal question jurisdiction removal is permitted even where a nonremovable claim is joined with the removable claim id if a criminal case price gouging etc is brought against enron is there any theory preemption primary jurisdiction or double jeopardy which would allow that criminal proceeding to be dismissed stayed or removed given the criminal penalty provisions of the federal power act our preliminary research shows that there is a body of substantive law dealing generally with the question of whether criminal proceedings are subject to the primary jurisdiction doctrine but no case which considered this question with respect to the federal power act specifically generally in one case concerning a district

regarding document subpoenas importance high original message from fergus gary s sent monday october am to meringolo peter subject fw enron proposals regarding document subpoenas importance high fyi thanks gary original message from fergus gary s sent friday october pm to hymcpuccagov cc mbd subject enron proposals regarding document subpoenas importance high harvey morris esq california public utilities commission public utilities commission san francisco california re i subpoenas served on enron power marketing inc epmi enron energy services operations inc and enron energy services inc collectively referred to as ees enron energy marketing corporation eemc and portland general electric corporation portland generalcollectively sometimes referred to as the enron entities harvey here are our proposals with respect to the enron entities production of documents pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued by the california public utility commission hereinafter the commission the enron entities are willing to assist the commission in undertaking its investigation into the problems in the california electric markets by producing the information specified on a timely basis we believe that the production we propose will enable the commission to commence its investigation much sooner than if the parties were forced to litigate all of the potential objections to the requests for production which are by any standard extremely broad and could involve millions of pages of documents we make these proposals pursuant to our email exchange of october with the understanding that the commission agrees that by cooperating offering to produce or producing documents the enron entities have not waived any objections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoever and that any claims defenses objections jurisdictional or otherwise or other responses have been specifically reserved and can be raised in the future if necessary for all of these proposals we exclude documents that are protected from disclosure by the attorney client and attorney work product privileges generally speaking the enron entities propose to produce documents for year as noted below we also understand that the commission will be obtaining documents from the iso and px and we will not attempt here to duplicate documents that we understand will be produced by those entities as you will see in the general documents that are offered here for production enron energy services operations inc is the parent of enron energy services inc and does not have operating authority or engage in wholesale or retail purchases or sales of energy thus the documents offered here with respect to those two entities originates with enron energy services inc but we have designated them both as ees we also do not propose to offer duplicative documents as between the enron entities general documents requests through because of the dynamic nature of the enron entities businesses the burden and expense on them to locate and produce every corporate organizational chart anywhere in their organizations since april is significant the enron entities will provide the commission with exemplars of their current organizational charts telephone directories and so called family trees to show its current organization to the extent that the enron entities can readily identify and locate exemplars of significant organizational charts telephone directories or so called family trees for earlier periods they will also make those available one enron entity portland general has published books on its corporate history if a list of those books would be helpful we can provide it with respect to the other enron entities to the extent that corporate histories can be found they will be produced we anticipate producing these documents in the first wave on october requests and the enron entities propose that their responses to requests will identify their relationship to affiliated companies and the transaction documents will identify its customers and suppliers we believe this information will be sufficient to illustrate these relationships for the staffs purposes financial documents requests through the enron entities will produce their public filings for the period requested with respect to financial data epmi ees and portland general will provide to the commission electronic transaction data the transaction documents for the purchase and sale of energy delivered which information includes economic data we anticipate producing public filings regarding financial data on october and the electronic transaction documents in the second wave of document productions generating documents requests and for the enron entities other than portland general the generation facilities are either nonexistent or limited in number and there will probably be limited documents available the enron entities to the extent they act as a scheduling coordinator or possessed the right to use or resell generation output do not have the specific documents that pertain to each generation unit requested the enron entities other than portland general do have documents and information for las vegas cogeneration we propose to produce these documents in the second wave of document productions for portland general the production of the requested documents would involve a tremendous volume of documents as portland general owned twenty generating facilities of a variety of types and sizes during portland general is a net importer of energy and can only generate about one half of its total energy demand as a result we question whether the effort required of portland general is warranted as its impact on the california wholesale market is necessarily limited nevertheless portland general proposes to provide for year electronic transaction documents in summary form similar to the data being provided by other enron entities to the extent relevant as discussed below we propose that the commission defer requesting production of other information until it has reviewed the information of generators who sell a significant proportion of their energy into the california market at that time a more accurate assessment can be made of whether this enormous effort will be valuable given the limited impact of portland general generation on the california wholesale market transaction documents requests and we understand that the commission will be obtaining trading data for the purchase and sale of energy delivered in california from the iso and px epmi can provide the commission several different sets of relevant transaction data for year in california and outside of california and real time for the purchase and sale of energy delivered with the date counterparty quantity delivery point hours price and whether it is a purchase or a sale because of the speed with which you want this information it is possible that some entries will be incomplete or inaccurate for those transactions where epmi served only as the scheduling coordinator we understand that the iso will show part of the transaction but there will not be a corresponding transaction in the epmi data we can provide quickly the reason is that this type of transaction is passed through to epmis customer on an accounting system rather than as part of the trading business ees can also provide similar data with respect to relevant wholesale and retail transactions with the proviso that with respect to retail transactions it will not include the specific names of its retail customers but instead will provide a blind customer number due to ees confidentiality obligations to those customers we anticipate producing the transaction documents in the second wave of document productions ferc documents request the enron entities will produce the requests for data they received from ferc and to the extent that ferc has been given responses copies of those responses we anticipate producing the ferc documents on october based upon discussions that we have had with the various enron entities we believe that we could make a second wave of productions on friday october it is possible that not all enron entities could make that date but we believe the bulk of the data could be available for production by then we propose to make these productions with the understanding that if any entity obtains a more stringent protective order than the one currently in place that all of the enron entities document productions will be protected by the most stringent protective order in addition if at the request of any party or nonparty to this proceeding the commission or a court of competent jurisdiction orders that the requests for production be limited reduced or eliminated the enron entities reserve the right to limit the production of documents in conformance with such order we understand that you will consider these proposals and let us know if they are acceptable to the commission if

senator_dunn_inv_ ::::::>>>>>> fw enron response to criminal charges here is followup research on the question of whether we could remove acriminal case against enron to federal court it is not as promising as wefirst thoughtthanksgary original message from smith amanda d sent thursday may pm to fergus gary s cc molland michael e meringolo peter subject enron response to criminal charges gary our earlier preliminary research reflected the fact that although it will likely be difficult it may be possible under the primary jurisdiction doctrine to refer criminal charges to ferc given the criminal penalty provisions of the federal power act however as it becomes more clear that if criminal charges are to be filed they will be filed in california it is necessary to revisit and expand this earlier research we noted earlier that there is a body of substantive law dealing generally with the question of whether criminal proceedings are subject to the primary jurisdiction doctrine but no case which considered this question with respect to the federal power act specifically based on this we concluded that it may be possible if difficult to argue that criminal charges should be referred to ferc under the primary jurisdiction doctrine an expansion of this research reveals that this potential for referral appears to only be applicable to federal criminal charges state criminal charges are not removable under usc section which provides that except as otherwise expressly provided by act of congress any civil action brought in a state court of which the district courts of the united states have original jurisdiction may be removed by the defendant or the defendants to the district court of the united states for the district and division embracing the place where such action is pending moreover our research has revealed no case in which state criminal charges were referred directly to any federal regulatory agency however our research has revealed another alternative to removal or referral of criminal charges see generally sprint corp v evans md al fsupp sprint corp v evans md al fsupp in the attorney general of alabama began an investigation of sprint corporation an international telecommunications company acting as a common carrier within the meaning of the federal communications act sprint among other things provided a service to subscribers pursuant to tariffs filed with the fcc to use these numbers a caller places a call through a local telephone company who connects the call to a long distance carrier such as sprint who generally then connected the call to the subscribers local telephone number in february sprint received a subpoena from the montgomery county grand jury commanding it to appear and produce all records relating to the service sprint produced the documents and learned that it was under investigation for violation of alabamas obscenity laws in connection with allegedly obscene content distributed over telephone lines in march sprint filed a motion for a temporary restraining order tro and a preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin the alabama attorney general from pursuing a criminal indictment against sprint for violation of the obscenity law sprint maintained enforcement of the antiobscenity law would interfere with federal statutory rights because regulation of interstate communications is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the fcc at the tro hearing the attorney general could not testify that the prosecution was not imminent and therefore the court issued the tro later in march the court decided sprints motion for a preliminary injunction sprint corp v evans md al fsupp at the hearing on this motion counsel for the attorney general stated that the attorney generals position regarding sprints criminal liability under the obscenity statute related to the its obligations under that law when a telephone customer complains that a subscribers message is offensive according to counsel if a customer complains sprint is obligated to either report the complaint to a prosecuting attorney or begin a declaratory judgment action against the subscriber the district court granted the preliminary injunction the court held that under the relevant eleventh circuit test for determining whether a preliminary injunction should issue the movant must show a substantial likelihood that she will ultimately prevail on the merits that she will suffer irreparable injury unless the injunction issues that the threatened injury to the movant outweighs whatever damage the proposed injunction may cause the opposing party and that if issued the injunction would not be adverse to the public interest sprint fsupp at before the court considered the first element of this test the court addressed the contention that the district court had no jurisdiction the court held that the supreme court however has held that federal courts have federalquestion jurisdiction under usca s to entertain suits to enjoin state officials from interfering with federal statutory rights the court then held that there was a substantial likelihood that sprint would prevail on the merits because to the extent that the alabama antiobscenity statute attempts to impose reporting requirements on communications by common carriers it is interstate in nature and preempted by federal law the statute is being used as a mechanism to impose new reporting requirements on common carriers with regard to their service currently under federal law common carriers do not have an affirmative obligation to investigate whether their facilities are being used by customers for a lawful purpose importantly the court did not reach the question whether the communications act preempts all alabama laws imposing liability for conduct of common carriers in the area of obscenity the court also rejected the attorney generals argument that a younger abstention was necessary the court disposed of the last three parts of the preliminary injunction test easily first the court held that irreparable harm would result because an indictment against sprint would cause great harm to its business reputation and would jeopardize its status as a government contractor second the court held that the potential harm to sprint outweighed the potential harm to the attorney general because although the attorney general relies on a state statute directed at the prosecution of the distribution of obscene matter the attorney general really seeks to impose interstate reporting requirements on common carriersin other words the generic proceeding at issue is the regulation of interstate telecommunications by common carriers outside the context of the distribution of obscene matter the attorney general clearly has no interest in such interstate regulation third the court held that the preliminary injunction serves the public interest by ensuring that the national interest in fulfilling the goals of the federal communications act sprint fsupp at in a separate decision almost a year later the district court granted in part sprints motion to refer certain issues to the fcc under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction sprint fsupp at prior to this motion the alabama attorney general changed its allegations regarding the illegality of sprints conduct under the obscenity law now alleging that sprint was not criminally liable because of a failure to report but because of a aiding and abetting theory the district court held in brief that referral to fcc under primary jurisdiction doctrine was warranted with regard to question of whether common carriers consistent with communications act may refuse to carry information providers program transmitted as service if program contains sexually explicit information that has not been adjudicated obscene and referral to fcc was not warranted with respect to question of whether attempted criminal prosecution of interstate common carrier under states antiobscenity laws for knowingly transmitting potentially obscene or obscene telephone communications through its interstate facilities is preempted by communications act sprint fsupp at the court then ordered that the record of the case be transmitted to the fcc that the preliminary injunction remain in effect and that all motions would be denied without prejudice until after the fcc rendered its decision obviously no analysis of the criminal charges against enron can yet be made but there is a significant chance that enron may be able to cast any criminal charges filed by the california attorney general as regulatory in nature moreover given relative lack of effect the alabama attorney generals change in position in the middle of the sprint case the regulatory aspect of the charges

senator_dunn_inv_ ::::::>>>>>> procedural defects in subpoena served by california ag on ees bobyou asked us to determine whether there are defects on the face of thesubpoena served upon ees which may prevent its enforcement in superiorcourt assuming the court holds the subpoena to the standard of adeposition subpoena and we think it should it is defective in at leasttwo respects first it was not served upon enron by personal service asrequired by ccp f second government code provides that theattorney general must first file a petition in superior court to require thecustodian of records to appear and testify while the subpoena requests adeposition of the enron ees custodian of records the ag did not file such apetition in addition government code provides that a person servedwith such a subpoena is not obliged to attend as a witness if he or she doesnot reside or do business within miles of the court in which he or she isasked to appearat your request we are now researching and will draft over the weekend amemorandum to address three issues arising from this subpoena whetherees has substantive grounds to refuse to comply with the subpoena or todisqualify the ag from enforcing it whether ees may successfully removeany compliance proceeding brought by the ag to federal court and theconsequences to ees if it should be held in contempt for refusal to complya discussion of the defects in the ees subpoena followsthere are three defects in the subpoena served on enron enery servicesees on may pursuant to california government code section the subpoena purports to require ees to produce its custodianof record on june to testify and to answer questions and toproduce documents responsive to the document requests subpoena at accordingly its demands are in the nature of a subpoena fordeposition and we analyze it on this basis defective service the subpoena appears defective because it was served by mailinstead of personal service service of a deposition subpoena pursuant tocalifornia code of civil procedure section f requires that thesubpoena be served personally not by mail for the reasons discussedbelow we believe that the subpoena served on ees is deposition subpoenasubject to the personal service requirements of ccp f first the subpoena is a deposition subpoena because itseeks to compel oral testimony from eess custodian of records the methodof taking oral testimony in california outside of court is by way ofdeposition ccp et seq here the subpoena commands eescustodian of records to testify and to answer questions subpoena at it also states that the custodian of records will be questionedunder oath regarding methods of compliance and whether all documentsdescribed in this subpoena have been produced subpoena at moreover the subpoena is issued pursuant to the powers conferred bycalifornia government code sections government codesection is entitled depositions petition order enforcementemphasis supplied the subpoena should thus properly be considered adeposition subpoena second the requirements of the california code of civilprocedure governing deposition subpoenas applies to the subpoena served onees government code section provides that in the case of depositionsubpoenas the deposition is governed by the california code of civilprocedure the attorney general has also issued a formal opinion statingthat the code of civil procedure governs subpoenas issued pursuant to govcode presumably gov code authorizingthe head of the department to issue a subpoena for the production of bookspapers or documents would be governed by the general law relating tosubpoenas duces tecum see sec ccp attorney generals opinions opinion no see also attorneygenerals opinions opinion no service of subpoena pursuant togov code must comply with code of civil procedure because the subpoena is a deposition subpoena subject to thecode of civil procedure the requirement that it be served personally notby mail should apply the subpoena is defective because the attorney general failed tofirst file a petition in superior court and obtain a court order requiringthe custodian of records to appear and testify government code section provides in any matter pending before a departmenthead the department head may cause the deposition of persons residingwithin or without the state to be taken by causing a petition to be filed inthe superior court in the county of sacramento reciting the nature of thematter pending the name and residence of the person whose testimony isdesired and asking that an order be made requiring the person to appear andtestify before an officer named in the petition for that purposethe attorney general while purporting to serve the subpoena pursuant tothis section pursuant to the powers conferred by california governmentcode section failed to comply with government code section by first filing a petition and obtaining a court order permitting thetaking of testimony for this reason the subpoena should be considereddefective the supoena is defective for purporting to compel attendance by thecustodian of records at a location more than fifty miles from his residence government code section provides a person is not obliged to attend as awitness in any matter under this article at a place out of the county inwhich he resides unless the distance is less than miles from his placeof business emphasis suppliedthe subpoena is addressed to eess custodian of records and is issuedprimarily for the purpose of having ees through your most knowledgeableperson testify and produce documents subpoena at presumablyeess custodian of records who is most knowledgeable with respect to thedocuments requested in the subpoena resides more than miles from sanfrancisco if so the subpoena would be defective and eess custodian ofrecords would not be obliged to attend as a witnessthis email message is for the sole use of the intended recipients and may contain confidential and privileged

senator_dunn_inv_ ::::::>>>>>> enforcement of subpoenas by california attorney general this memorandum further analyzes the ability of enron and ees to remove tofederal court a california state court proceeding to enforce a subpoena fordocuments and testimony it specifically addresses the arguments raised bythe briefs filed by the reliant mirant and the california attorney generalin april and may in litigation relating to a similar enforcementproceeding in reliant energy power generation inc et al v lockyercalifornia superior court los angeles county case no bc in light of the reliant case if ees removes an enforcement proceeding tofederal court the ag will probably argue that the petition for removal isnot a civil action because a petition to enforce the subpoena is aspecial proceeding and not an action we also anticipate that the agwill argue that there is no federal question because the government codesections provide an exclusive statutory scheme which provides jurisdictiononly to the california superior courtthese arguments do not change our previous analysis but highlight the ourconclusion assuming the existence of a federal question in the agsenforcement petition ees can file a petition for removal but its burden toprevail on a motion for remand will be difficult to meeti summary of reliant et al v lockyerin early lockyer served subpoenas for documents on reliant and mirantunder government code sections et seq reliant and mirant did notdispute the ags ability to seek this information and voluntarily producednonconfidential information however reliant and mirant disputed the agsability to disclose confidential information without a protective orderseveral days before the ag as a petitioner filed an enforcement action insan francisco superior court to compel reliant and mirant to producedocuments reliant and mirant affirmatively filed a complaint as plaintiffsfor declaratory relief and an injunction in the los angeles superior courtthe ag filed a motion to dismiss the reliant action primarily on the groundsthat the government code establishes the exclusive procedure for enforcementof this subpoena ie the ags filing of a petition to enforce thesubpoena the government code does not allow for the filing of injunctiverelief and granting an injunction would violate the separation of powersand circumvent the special proceedings of the government codeon may the court denied the ags demurrer the ag then agreed to acompromise interim protective order and mirant and reliant producedrequested documents while reserving rights to continue the litigationii case or controversy under article iiias an initial matter we considered whether an enforcement proceedingconstitutes a case or controversy under article iii of the united statesconstitution we conclude it probably doesthe power of federal courts is constitutionally limited to cases andcontroversies see flast v cohen us this doctrinelimits the courts to questions presented in an adversary context and in aform historically viewed as capable of resolution through the judicialprocess id at furthermore article iii is intended to define therole assigned to the judiciary in a tripartite allocation of power to assurethat the federal courts will not intrude into areas committed to the otherbranches of government id applications of this doctrine include afinding of no justiciable controversy when the parties seek adjudication ofonly political questions when the parties are asking for only advisoryopinions when the question sought to be adjudicated has been mooted bysubsequent developments and where there is no standing to maintain theaction idthis is not the issue here upon the filing of a petition the ag willprobably not dispute that there is a controversy the ag has conceded thatas a matter of law there is no actual controversy in an investigatoryproceeding until the attorney general moves to enforce the subpoena agreply at we found no cases where removal of a similar petition wasdenied on the ground that it did not prevent a case or controversy underarticle iiiiii removal of petitionas discussed in our previous memorandum removal jurisdiction is conferredby federal statute see usc a this statute provides inrelevant part that except as otherwise expressly provided by act of congressany civil action brought in a state court of which the district courts ofthe united states have original jurisdiction may be removed by thedefendant or the defendants to the district court of the united states forthe district and division embracing the place where such action is pendingas we previously concluded in order for ees to remove any enforcementaction filed by the ag ees must show that the petition is a civilaction under the removal statute and the ags investigation whichunderlies the subpoena enforcement action is preempted by federal law thusmaking removal proper on the basis of federal question removal jurisdictionthe ag likely will argue that that the petition to enforce the subpoenais not a civil action but rather is a special proceeding and that thepetition does not present a federal question because it is undertaking anenforcement procedure created by california statutory which grants exclusivejurisdiction to california courts these arguments are analyzed below a ags argument that petition is not an actionfirst ees must show that a petition by the ag to enforce a subpoena is acivil action under federal law the definition of civil action isextremely broad and appears to cover everything except criminal proceedingsin our previous memorandum we concluded that ees has a good faith argumentthat a petition is a civil action for the purposes of removal inreliant et al v lockyer filed in the superior court county of losangeles the ag argued that petitions under the government code are specialproceedings not civil actions the ags arguments do not change ourprevious conclusionsthe ags arguments are founded solely upon language in see people ex relfranchise tax board v superior court calappd in thatcase the court of appeals stated that the hearing under section is a specialproceeding in practice the term special proceeding is used incontradistinction to action it refers only to proceedings which were notunder the common law or equity practice either an action at law or a suitin equity they are proceedings which may be commenced independently of apending action by petition or motion upon notice in order to obtainspecial reliefid at despite the ags arguments franchise tax board has no weight in determiningwhether the petition is a civil action under the federal removal statutefederal law determines whether there is an action is a civil action seeeg in re exhumation of meriwether lewis nd tenn fsupp without a doubt the term civil action has been construed broadlyby the federal courts wright miller b fed practice and procjuris d west according to wright miller the limitation to civil actions is not particularlyimportant however since the term civil action has been construed broadlyby the federal courts for example proceedings for garnishment orcondemnation and actions to compel arbitration or to confirm or vacate anarbitration award are considered civil actions within the meaning of thefederal removal statute moreover special federal statutes permit theremoval of certain noncivil proceedings in effect therefore thelimitation to civil actions in section may mean no more than that statecourt criminal and perhaps penalty actions are not removable except asotherwise provided by a specific federal statuteapplying a broad definition of civil action courts have held thatpetitions to exhume a body petition to enforce administrative subpoenasgarnishment actions actions to compel arbitration and contempt proceedingsare civil actions within the scope of section see eg agosto vbarcelo d p r f supp enforcement ofadministrative subpoena overruled on other grounds st cir fd lewis v blackmon s d miss f supp garnishmentaction sears roebuck and co v glenwal co sdny f supp action to compel arbitration reynolds metals co v crowther d mass f supp contempt proceeding in re exhumation ofmeriwether lewis f supp petition to exhume bodymoreover the cases relied upon by the ag support the notion that theproceedings to enforce the subpoena are akin to an action see people exrel franchise tax board v superior court calappd inhearing on petition under the government code court may judicially testwhether the subpoena duces tecum conforms to the requisite legal andconstitutional standards fielder v berkeley properties co calappd hearing on petition to enforce a subpoena provides anopportunity for adjudication of all claimed constitutional and legal rightsbefore one is required to obey the subpoenathe ag also relies on triple a machine shop inc v california calappd this case is inapplicable triple a has nothing to do withthe application of the government code at issue or the enforcement ofsubpoenas under the government code rather triple a analyzed thepropriety of enjoining criminal investigations in that case the sanfrancisco district attorney and the state department of health commenced acriminal and civil investigation into violations of law governing thestorage and disposal of hazardous waste the district attorney obtained asearch warrant the district attorney also brought a suit to enjoindefendants from dissipating any assets defendant filed an action forinjunctive relief to enjoin the state from contacting high level managerialemployees in violation of attorney client privilege and in violation oftheir ethical duties the injunction was issued the court of appealsreversed holding that there was no threat of misconduct by the districtattorney or violations of the attorney client privilege the court furtherstated that the most significant effect of theinjunction lies in its impact on the investigation and prosecution of thecriminal charges the separation of powers doctrine requires judicialrestraint in enjoining criminal investigations or prosecutions thediscretionary authority vested in the district attorney to investigate andprosecute criminal conduct is considered too vital to the interest of publicorder to be subjected to prior restraint by the courts except underextraordinary circumstancesid at emphasis addedees is not asking the court to enjoin the ags investigation ees is merelyinvoking the jurisdiction of the federal court pursuant to the federalremoval statutes in order to litigate the legal and constitutional issuesrelated to the ags subpoena thus triple a is inapposite b the petition must present a federal questionsecond ees must also argue that a federal question appears on the face ofplaintiffs wellpleaded complaint or that plaintiffs artfully pleadedcomplaint involves a federal question as in the currently pending civillawsuits ees will argue that the ags investigation or some of it iscompletely preempted by the federal power act which governs wholesale energyprices and thus presents a federal question without a doubt this presentsthe biggest obstacle to successful removal especially since ees cannotinject a federal question sufficient to justify removal by way of defensethis burden may be somewhat easier for enron or enron wholesale services tomeet since neither company does business on the retail level in californiaas ees does however as discussed in our previous memorandum both ees andenron must contend with contrary ninth circuit precedent see lewis vyounger th cir fd in addition the ag will argue thatthe petition does not present a federal question but is merely seeking toenforce a subpoena

edison michael molland amanda smith and twoit professionals working with ees jon eastlund and pete van de gohn todaydiscussed a going forward document retention policy for ees as a result ofthe california ags subpoena this is a summary of our discussion agreement with ag with respect to epmiportland i per myconversation with gary fergus confirmed that the document retention policythat was negotiated in december with the ag with respect to epmi inportland is as follows all employees are instructed not to delete anyemail for hours each hours a backup snapshot of the entire emailserver in portland is taken after hours employees may delete emailthis policy has been in place since middecember and backup tapes shouldexist for email for each day from middecember through the present description of email server organization within ees all eesemployees are on one of two email systems the exchange serverlegacysystem or lotus notes the exchangelegacy system is run off of threeservers located in san ramon california costa mesa california andphoenix arizona the lotus notes server is in houston the majority ofees personnel in california probably are on the exchangelegacy server butthere is no way of knowing who is which server without individuallychecking ees personnel who were originally hired in california probablyuse the legacy system generally the only incalifornia personnel who usethe lotus notes system are those who were originally hired by ees to workoutside of california virtually all ees employees outside california usethe lotus notes system current email retention of legacy system the customary practice isto keep daily back up tapes which are over written weekly as well as oneweekly snapshot of the system which is overwritten after days as oflast week the exchangelegacy server is being preserved as follows thedaily and weekly tapes are no longer being overwritten and are beingpreserved by jon eastlund jon is checking with his subordinate in costamesa to confirm that this is also being done in costa mesa jon reportsthat the earliest weekly back up tape which is still preserved dates frommay th he is keeping that tape in san ramon until it can be picked up bybrobeck retention of email of lotus notes system the lotus notes server isbacked up every day but the back tapes are erased after seven days and thispolicy is continuing as of several weeks ago when b williams first sentout notification to pete van de gohn and the it staff in houston the lotusnotes server is being preserved as follows the auto purge and the deletefunctions on the computers of certain key personnel have been disabled forcertain ees personneleg sunde and benevides in addition morerecently the auto purge function was disabled on the computers ofadditional personnel the golden bear team who use the system as oftoday pete will disable the delete function for those additional personnelas well going forward we discussed several different policies that eesmight institute first we discussed the idea of instituting a policy likethat in place at epmi in portland ie preserving the daily back up tapesthat are already being made but overwritten after a week or soin theordinary course of business this policy will create a significant amountof information that will be difficult and expensive to search if it isrequested however it is apparently consistent with the policy in place atepmi portland and is possible to do on both email systems second as analternative to preserving backup tapes we discussed disabling the deletefunction on the computers of key personnel this is now being done for thelotus notes system however we understand that the exchangelegacy systemmay not have an auto purge function jon will check whether the deletedisabling function can be accomplished on the exchangelegacy system andreport back this second alternative preserves email that will berelatively easy to search for production however it may be difficult toimplement for california personal on the legacy email system third wediscussed instructing key ees personnel at issue to move all potentiallyresponsive emails into folders on the system which may they be protectedreproduced and reviewedthis would be the least burdensome potentiallyleaves us open to the fox is guarding the henhouse argument by the ag data serverswe discussed data servers briefly all personnel are ondifferent servers for their word documents and spread sheets this systemhas no autopurge function however the only way that a document can bedeleted is if a user actually deliberately deletes it from the systemaccordingly there seems less need to initiate further backup of thisserver finally we agreed ees lawyers should send emails to all key eespersonnel confirming our earlier instruction to them that they not deleteemail documents or messages a draft email on this subject follows this email confirms that ees has instituted an interim documentretention policy as a result of the investigation commenced by thecalifornia attorney general until further notice please do not deleteany nonpersonal email from your inbox or any documents

senator_dunn_inv_ ::::::>>>>>> status report on document identification at enron corp offices i n san francisco amanda smith peter meringolo and i met with officers andadministrators at the san francisco offices of enron corp this morning andidentified documents responsive to the dunn committee subpoena amanda andpeter then collected and reviewed potentially responsive documents in theafternoon they will continue to do so with the assistance of twoparalegals tomorrow assuming we do not produce documents relating to thedevelopment and siting of generation facilities which comprise the lionschair of the documents in san francisco we estimate there are about tenboxes of responsive hard copy documents in the office however we have notyet reviewed any electronic documents the following summarizes thesediscussions and the status of document identification most of the documents in the sf office correspond to one of thethree major functions of the office the predominant operation is thedevelopment of power generation facilities in the western united statesunder the supervision of dave parquet second the office markets wholesalepower to municipal utilities and other customers under the direction of mikemcdonald both these operations are done by enron north american and bothparquay and mcdonald are vice presidents of enron north america mcdonaldworks closely with epmi in portland the final significant function of theoffice consists of legislative and regulatory affairs which is part ofenron corp and managed by sue mara we reviewed many of the documents within the custody of personsworking under the management of parquet and mara mcdonald is on vacationuntil june and has not returned phone calls to his home message machinegiven his close relationship to epmi in portland we need to reach him soonto interview him on the subject he is said to have potentially sensitivepricing and financial information relating to wholesale power on his harddrive the following summarizes our review of the documents in the parquetand mara supervised operations mara many documents may be privileged nonprivileged documents donot appear especially sensitive examples are reports of trade associationmeetings and puc and other regulatory proceedings parquet parquet was on the board of iso he has about two boxes ofresponsive iso information most appear non sensitive but may requirenotice to iso prior to production there is also some bid informationregarding an enron offer to buy a pg and e generating facility laterpurchased by mirant these documents are also nonsensitive parquet hasfinancial documents including the allocation of profit and loss to certainenron subsidiaries however there are tens to of boxes of documents relatingto power plants enron has or is planning to develop in the western unitedstates generally these type of documents do not appear called for in thesubpoena however embedded within these development plans are documentsthat are responsive to other categories of the subpoena and sensitive suchas pricing curves information about future contracts and forecasts ofsupply and demand for power parquay says these are competitively sensitivedocuments it would take several days to review these documents furthermany contain third party information subject to confidentiality agreementswith such third parties if we produce them we would need to notify thesethird parties soon i suggest we not produce these documents but do soopenly by disclosing to drivon that we are treating documents relating tositing of power plants not operated by enron as nonresponsive mcdonald this operating unit has few hard copy documents mostsensitive information is said to be on mcdonalds hard drive includingfinancial information that reportedly shows how much money enron made incalifornia in the past year or two by selling wholesale power someone needsto reach mcdonald so we can ask him about it document retention the office manager says that a backup tape ismade of the server and the h drives on each computer every day days ofbackup tapes are kept before they are overwritten the backup tape fromevery fourth friday of each month is kept permanently they believe emailis so preserved on this back up tapes but say that only people in houston know for sure we should find out we asked the office manager toretain copies of all backup tapes going forward ees the ees personnel in san francisco have few responsivedocuments the dunn subpoena asks for all of enrons contracts for retailsale of power which are also requested by the ag from ees these probablytotal or so boxes we will ask the ees offices in san ramon and costamesa offices which house these contracts to copy them and send them to usfor our review we will hold them until we make a decision whether toproduce them either to the ag or dunn puc production enron previously produced about a half box ofdocuments to the puc most are responsive and should be also produced todunn i expect we will have completed at least a cursory review of theresponsive hard copy documents in san francisco that do not pertain to plantconstruction and operation by tomorrow afternoon we then need to review thedocuments on the hard drives of parquay and mcdonald hopefully by thursdayafternoon we will collect examples of the most sensitive documents we

afternoonwe have stopped plans to copy the ees contracts withcustomers for power pending further discussions with you here are theconsiderations that seem relevant both the ag and dunn subpoenas request these contracts andsupporting documents they are probably the only significant amount of eesdocuments in california that are responsive to the dunn subpoena they are currently kept in several places in the san ramon officecosta mesa and long beach if we plan to gather them for a production in oraround sacramento soon we should consider making copies of the southerncalifornia contracts so they are available for review and production innorthern california the extent of the southern california contractdocuments is about four or five boxes san ramon probably has about ten wecould more easily hold off on the copying in san ramon since it is closeboth to our offices and sacramento it is unlikely we can shift copying costs for these documents todunns committee or the ag we could produce them in a central location buti doubt we can force them to go to several locations in the state to reviewdocuments that fall in this categoryoriginal messagefrom robertcwilliamsenroncom

amanda smith peter meringolo and i met with officers and administrators at the san francisco offices of enron corp this morning and identified documents responsive to the dunn committee subpoena amanda and peter then collected and reviewed potentially responsive documents in the afternoon they will continue to do so with the assistance of two paralegals tomorrow assuming we do not produce documents relating to the development and siting of generation facilities which comprise the lions chair of the documents in san francisco we estimate there are about ten boxes of responsive hard copy documents in the office however we have not yet reviewed any electronic documents the following summarizes these discussions and the status of document identification most of the documents in the sf office correspond to one of the three major functions of the office the predominant operation is the development of power generation facilities in the western united states under the supervision of dave parquet second the office markets wholesale power to municipal utilities and other customers under the direction of mike mcdonald both these operations are done by enron north american and both parquay and mcdonald are vice presidents of enron north america mcdonald works closely with epmi in portland the final significant function of the office consists of legislative and regulatory affairs which is part of enron corp and managed by sue mara we reviewed many of the documents within the custody of persons working under the management of parquet and mara mcdonald is on vacation until june and has not returned phone calls to his home message machine given his close relationship to epmi in portland we need to reach him soon to interview him on the subject he is said to have potentially sensitive pricing and financial information relating to wholesale power on his hard drive the following summarizes our review of the documents in the parquet and mara supervised operations mara many documents may be privileged nonprivileged documents do not appear especially sensitive examples are reports of trade association meetings and puc and other regulatory proceedings parquet parquet was on the board of iso he has about two boxes of responsive iso information most appear non sensitive but may require notice to iso prior to production there is also some bid information regarding an enron offer to buy a pg and e generating facility later purchased by mirant these documents are also nonsensitive parquet has financial documents including the allocation of profit and loss to certain enron subsidiaries however there are tens to of boxes of documents relating to power plants enron has or is planning to develop in the western united states generally these type of documents do not appear called for in the subpoena however embedded within these development plans are documents that are responsive to other categories of the subpoena and sensitive such as pricing curves information about future contracts and forecasts of supply and demand for power parquay says these are competitively sensitive documents it would take several days to review these documents further many contain third party information subject to confidentiality agreements with such third parties if we produce them we would need to notify these third parties soon i suggest we not produce these documents but do so openly by disclosing to drivon that we are treating documents relating to siting of power plants not operated by enron as nonresponsive mcdonald this operating unit has few hard copy documents most sensitive information is said to be on mcdonalds hard drive including financial information that reportedly shows how much money enron made in california in the past year or two by selling wholesale power someone needs to reach mcdonald so we can ask him about it document retention the office manager says that a backup tape is made of the server and the h drives on each computer every day days of backup tapes are kept before they are overwritten the backup tape from every fourth friday of each month is kept permanently they believe email is so preserved on this back up tapes but say that only people in houston know for sure we should find out we asked the office manager to retain copies of all backup tapes going forward ees the ees personnel in san francisco have few responsive documents the dunn subpoena asks for all of enrons contracts for retail sale of power which are also requested by the ag from ees these probably total or so boxes we will ask the ees offices in san ramon and costa mesa offices which house these contracts to copy them and send them to us for our review we will hold them until we make a decision whether to produce them either to the ag or dunn puc production enron previously produced about a half box of documents to the puc most are responsive and should be also produced to dunn i expect we will have completed at least a cursory review of the responsive hard copy documents in san francisco that do not pertain to plant construction and operation by tomorrow afternoon we then need to review the documents on the hard drives of parquay and mcdonald hopefully by thursday afternoon we will collect examples of the most sensitive documents we find tomorrow and send them tuesday evening to bob williams for review this email

dunns committee and on ees by the ag todays meeting with dave parquet amanda smith and i met with dave parquet at the enron corp offices in san francisco late this afternoon and then talked with him this evening he generally described the documents in the office he describes most as confidential or proprietary he will assemble the team leaders in the office and meet with amanda and me and two other associates monday morning we should be able to complete a snapshot of the documents in the office by mid tuesday our discussions raised the following issues dave said enron has a small

small office in long beach amanda will talk to their employees monday a master limited partnership eott energy also has an office in long beach they may be a subsidiary of enron corp please let us know if we should contact him many documents in san francisco are covered by confidentiality agreements with enrons clients dave said the confidentiality of these documents are not clear on their face and we should involve an enron attorney in portland he suggested karen jones to work on this issue with us document retention david said he is concerned that there is no clear corporate guideline for email retention in his office we should send him and the directors in that office as well as all ees directors a clear directive as soon as possible for the time being he is following oral instructions not to delete email or other documents earlier amanda talked the ees it manager who said that it is not possible to automatically save email from most ees personnel in california those who are on the legacy email system until we solve this problem i suggest we retain the daily backup tapes made for the legacy system just as we are doing for our portland office telephone call with ags office regarding the ees subpoena this afternoon i talked to hirem pattel a deputy ag who is temporarily in charge of the ees investigation i told him we would produce some documents without waiving our objections but needed to discuss any production with him beforehand i repeated bobs offer to meet next friday he said they would not meet with us until we again responded to the subpoena and said in writing we would produce documents i told him we had no obligation to do that and wanted to meet with them first he then said he would have his supervisor call me early next week directives to california officers all the ees and enron people we have talked with in the past two weeks have been cooperative given the time crunch however it would be helpful if an enron lawyer

senator_dunn_inv_ ::::::>>>>>> discussion of document retention policy for ees bob williams andrew edison michael molland amanda smith and twoit professionals working with ees jon eastlund and pete van de gohn todaydiscussed a going forward document retention policy for ees as a result ofthe california ags subpoena this is a summary of our discussion agreement with ag with respect to epmiportland i per myconversation with gary fergus confirmed that the document retention policythat was negotiated in december with the ag with respect to epmi inportland is as follows all employees are instructed not to delete anyemail for hours each hours a backup snapshot of the entire emailserver in portland is taken after hours employees may delete emailthis policy has been in place since middecember and backup tapes shouldexist for email for each day from middecember through the present description of email server organization within ees all eesemployees are on one of two email systems the exchange serverlegacysystem or lotus notes the exchangelegacy system is run off of threeservers located in san ramon california costa mesa california andphoenix arizona the lotus notes server is in houston the majority ofees personnel in california probably are on the exchangelegacy server butthere is no way of knowing who is which server without individuallychecking ees personnel who were originally hired in california probablyuse the legacy system generally the only incalifornia personnel who usethe lotus notes system are those who were originally hired by ees to workoutside of california virtually all ees employees outside california usethe lotus notes system current email retention of legacy system the customary practice isto keep daily back up tapes which are over written weekly as well as oneweekly snapshot of the system which is overwritten after days as oflast week the exchangelegacy server is being preserved as follows thedaily and weekly tapes are no longer being overwritten and are beingpreserved by jon eastlund jon is checking with his subordinate in costamesa to confirm that this is also being done in costa mesa jon reportsthat the earliest weekly back up tape which is still preserved dates frommay th he is keeping that tape in san ramon until it can be picked up bybrobeck retention of email of lotus notes system the lotus notes server isbacked up every day but the back tapes are erased after seven days and thispolicy is continuing as of several weeks ago when b williams first sentout notification to pete van de gohn and the it staff in houston the lotusnotes server is being preserved as follows the auto purge and the deletefunctions on the computers of certain key personnel have been disabled forcertain ees personneleg sunde and benevides in addition morerecently the auto purge function was disabled on the computers ofadditional personnel the golden bear team who use the system as oftoday pete will disable the delete function for those additional personnelas well going forward we discussed several different policies that eesmight institute first we discussed the idea of instituting a policy likethat in place at epmi in portland ie preserving the daily back up tapesthat are already being made but overwritten after a week or soin theordinary course of business this policy will create a significant amountof information that will be difficult and expensive to search if it isrequested however it is apparently consistent with the policy in place atepmi portland and is possible to do on both email systems second as analternative to preserving backup tapes we discussed disabling the deletefunction on the computers of key personnel this is now being done for thelotus notes system however we understand that the exchangelegacy systemmay not have an auto purge function jon will check whether the deletedisabling function can be accomplished on the exchangelegacy system andreport back this second alternative preserves email that will berelatively easy to search for production however it may be difficult toimplement for california personal on the legacy email system third wediscussed instructing key ees personnel at issue to move all potentiallyresponsive emails into folders on the system which may they be protectedreproduced and reviewedthis would be the least burdensome potentiallyleaves us open to the fox is guarding the henhouse argument by the ag data serverswe discussed data servers briefly all personnel are ondifferent servers for their word documents and spread sheets this systemhas no autopurge function however the only way that a document can bedeleted is if a user actually deliberately deletes it from the systemaccordingly there seems less need to initiate further backup of thisserver finally we agreed ees lawyers should send emails to all key eespersonnel confirming our earlier instruction to them that they not deleteemail documents or messages a draft email on this subject follows this email confirms that ees has instituted an interim documentretention policy as a result of the investigation commenced by thecalifornia attorney general until further notice please do not deleteany nonpersonal email from your inbox or any documents from the dataservers in lieu of deleting any of your email please transfer it to afolder in your

status of enron corporations response to subpoena from senator dunnwe are prepared to produce more than pages of documents to thesacramento repository on monday in response to the subpoena from senatordunn this memorandum sets forth the remaining issues to be resolved beforeenrons production of documents in california is completethis memorandum is divided into three sections substantive issues tobe resolved documents remaining to be reviewed and logisticalissues to be addressed by mike kirby a substantive issueswe have prepared and sent to mike kirby and richard sanders and others apacket of documents which we need to discuss as soon as possible we needguidance about whether we ought to produce these types of documents thesedocuments include bids made to dwr iso the subpoena calls for bids made to the isoand px and we assume that this means bid data however enron did submitbids to provide for summer reliability generation and to provide energy tothe dwr should we produce these documents enron business plans these documents talk in general terms aboutstrategies for developing revenue in california not necessarily forecastsof revenue these documents fall on the fringe of what has been asked forby the subpoena siting generation development documents this is a broadcategory of documents which are irrelevant to the senate investigationhowever if the subpoena is broadly and perhaps fairly read manydocuments within this category may be responsive our suggestion is tocarve out these documents and let the senate committee know that we aredoing so for example dunn asks for information about generation units owned orcontrolled by enron we found documents in which enron controlled thedevelopment of the unit but then sold it to a third party likewise enronis involved in a project to expand las vegas cogen facility many of these documents contain financial data such assupply and demand curves and pricing data in order to analyze whether to goforward with the project we have numerous proposal and drafts but not finalizeddeals in which negotiated to act as scheduling coordinators or to buy theenergy from the facility these drafts are not called for by the subpoenabut documents related to final contracts are we have gathered documents related to negotiations with qfsto serve as scheduling coordinators which apparently coincide withdivestiture by the utilities documents related to meetings of the independent energy producersiep trade association these documents clearly are responsive manyhowever contain sensitive and privilege information including informationabout lobbying efforts thus we need to provide notice to the iep that weare required to produce these documents and give them an opportunity toreview these documents before we produce them additionally we shouldcontact their counsel to see what if anything has already been produced iassume that they have been subpoenaed b enron corp documents in san francisco yet to be reviewedwe have almost completed our review of potentially responsive materialsmaintained in the san francisco office we will complete this review nextweek and produce any additional documents to the repository the followingis a list of the remaining materials to be reviewed electronic documents on sue maras hard drive email messages maintained by dave parquet mike mcdonald and suemara interview mike mcdonald review addition materials relating to qfs recently located byenron c logistical issues and questions for mike kirby delivering boxes to sacramento repositorywe need someone to drive the boxes to sacramento and obtain a key for therepository space bob webb a senior paralegal has volunteered if weneed him to go staffing the sacramento repository we assume that we will need a proctor when the senate committee reviews thedocuments can we work out a schedule or protocol with them moreover wewill need to have someone drive to sacramento each time we producedocuments we cannot simply

the text of this email discussion of specific document requestsno all contracts for retail sale these are both in california andhoustonnos and all contracts under which ees has purchased electricity onthe western interconnection between and the end of about fivepercent of these contracts are for green power made with various entitiesthe vast majority approximately are contracts with epmi whichpurchased all electricity load for ees there may be also a few contractswith apx ees has paper fax copies of all these deals their understandingis that epmi charged ees exactly what the utilities would have paid on thecalifornia market while they do not know how epmi actually provided forthe power they believe epmi probably did not buy most of it on thecalifornia market they believe all these contracts are voidable if theyare revealed to any third party they characterize all this information asextremely sensitive they believe with this information if given enoughtime and a few other variables parties could construct enrons pricecurvesno documents which identify the purchases of ees for power in the dayahead hour ahead or real time markets operated by the px or cal iso theysay there are none ees was a scheduling coordinator but never used thefunctionno documents relating to portfolio of energy supply sources relied uponees to meet contractual obligations to nus customers in california thereare no such documentsno documents relating to the assessment of risks regarding the costof purchasing electricity in california they do not believe there are suchdocuments but there may be presentations on this issueno documents relating to strategies or business plans designed tominimize risks with regard to the cost of purchasing electricity necessaryto serve customers all ees officers and traders receive daily reports tocorporate goals for ees and show how ees was performing in conformity withthese goals they characterized these documents as extremely sensitivethey use these on a daily basis most of these goals are based upon theprice curves they also receive month end reports which show how eachdivision is doing according to these corporate goals they believe that

in california during theperiod in question they believe doug condon sp or harold buchanan wouldhave these documentsno documents that show sales to california department of waterresources they dont believe there are such documentsnos contracts obligating them to either supply or purchaseelectricity which they prematurely terminated they dont believe there areany contracts which they prematurely terminated some contracts wereterminated but by agreement the only possible exception may be theuniversity of california contractno organizational charts which show the persons with authority forrisk

enforcement proceeding filed against ees by the agyesterday my partner tom peterson drawing on the earlier work of petermeringolo and amanda smith looked at this issue yesterday afternoon and ihave discussed it with him here briefly is our initial analysis thebottom line if ees decides to raise issues relating the confidentiality ofthe documents and the bias of lockyer in conjunction with the enforcementaction it probably needs to file either a cross complaint or separateaction with the court to address to these issues mike and i will call youwhen we return from court this afternoon to discuss this further a summaryof toms initial analysis follows under gov code section the ag probably must file thecontemplated special proceeding to enforce the subpoena and obtain an ordercompelling production before proceeding further under section thelanguage shall suggests there is no discretion about the issuance of theorder to show cause which acts like a summons and probably only isadjudicatory in the sense that it specifies dates by which the issues onthe petition will be joined see also brovelli cald therefore we probably cannot object to the proceedings today beingconducted before a commissioner we probably can object if he refuses toorder a hearing before a superior court judge the limits of the review available by the court concerning issuesraised by an enforcement action under section are unclear thestatute says that the court shall order compliance with the subpoena ifit appears to the court that the subpoena was regularly issued thereis case law suggesting on the one hand that this scheme provides anopportunity for adjudication of all claimed constitutional and legal rightsbefore one is required to obey the command of a subpoena duces tecum issuedfor investigative purposes people v west coast calappd at on the other hand the court has no power to grant equitable remedies and aparty is not entitled to all of the protections by way of hearing and thelike that might be available by way of a motion to quash fiedler calappd at see also franchise tax calappd at on the one hand it would seem that we should be able to argueterritoriality objectionsthese seem jurisdictional and related to thepower of the ag on the other hand we cant get any relief like adeclaration or an injunction because that is equitable this seems tohave been a major part of the reason that reliant etc sued in a separateaction in la because they wanted to enjoin the ag from sharing the materialthat they produced to the ag of course if we can assert objections aslegal and constitutional reasons not to produce we may not need equitablerelief just an order finding that the administrative subpoena is notregularly issued under the gov code scheme it is very unclear as towhether possible objection on the ground that the ag should be disqualifiedcould be considered by the court as part of the ags enforcement action onemight be able to argue that a lawfully constituted and conductedinvestigation by a duly qualified officer is part of the calculationimplicit in regularly issued conversely a disqualification motion isnot within the contemplation of the immediate code sections surroundingsection and the court might consider this such a significant motionthat it would be reluctant to think it proper under the gov code scheme in view of we may want to file an action for declaratory reliefeither because we really think that the section proceeding may not bethe proper vehicle to adjudicate our objections or because we want to takeaway any issue for the ag who will probably assert that an enforcementaction under the government code permits only very narrow review we couldtherefore file such an action and say that we are doing this because wewant to obviate any procedural issues and clear the path so we can get thecourt to resolve all the disputes and not have a piecemeal process assuming we decide for whatever reason to file an action fordeclaratory relief we could file our own action and try to get it joinedwith the section proceeding or we could consider filing acrosscomplaint in the section action the ability to do the latteris debatable there is a wellrecognized difference under the californiacodes between an action and a special proceeding the gov code matter is aspecial proceeding in tide water the supreme court said that under thethen prevailing crosscomplaint statute a suit for special proceeding wouldnot support a crosscomplaint cal d at however the code hassince been amended and may permit a cross complaint for the followingreasons first ccp section now uses the word action in a bordersense it says a party may file a crosscomplaint against any other partywho has filed a complaint against him it says that this does not authorizea crosscomplaint under section but that code section isnt anaction in the code sense but a special proceeding so you can say themeaning of the word action in the old section construed by the supremecourt in tide water has been completely changed and the legislature hasnow expanded the definition to refer to a proceeding in court whether anaction or a special proceeding the ag will probably argue that the govcode action is commenced by a petition rather than a complaint and thuswill not support a cross complaint we would need to analyze this furtheralso in support of filing a crosscomplaint under the new amended code isccp section a which says that the compulsory crosscomplaint rulesdo not apply to special proceedings if the parts of the ccp applicable tojoinder did not otherwise apply to special proceedings then there would notbe any reason to codify this carve out finally tide water says that thecourt has discretion based on inherent power ccp section toentertain what would otherwise amount to an unauthorized crosscomplaintappended to a special proceeding nb a be aware that there is someauthority for the idea that parts of the ccp applicable to actions part do not apply to special proceedings unless expressly incorporated seealrb calappd at compare ccp adopting action rules intospecial proceedings of mandate review and prohibition b be awarethat an action for declaratory relief is itself a special proceeding in summary we should consider responding to the ags case with acrosscomplaint for declaratory relief or file one independently wed leantoward the crosscomplaint and take our chances on a motion to dismiss itprocedurally since we think the court would want to get all the issuesresolved there is a split of authority on whether the disposition of thesection proceeding is appealable i think it may be a distinctionwithout a practical difference since a writ of mandate is available if wewant to seek appellate review of an order for us to produce issued underthe gov code whether we proceed by appeal or writ of mandateprohibitionwe would have to make a prompt filling and seek urgent relief and the issuewould come to a head that way by the decision whether or not to defercompliance while appellate review proceedsthis email message is for the sole use of the intended recipients and may contain

repository on monday in response to the subpoena from senatordunn this memorandum sets forth the remaining issues to be resolved beforeenrons production of documents in california is completethis memorandum is divided into three sections substantive issues tobe resolved documents remaining to be reviewed and logisticalissues to be addressed by mike kirby a substantive issueswe have prepared and sent to mike kirby and richard sanders and others apacket of documents which we need to discuss as soon as possible we needguidance about whether we ought to produce these types of documents thesedocuments include bids made to dwr iso the subpoena calls for bids made to the isoand px and we assume that this means bid data however enron did submitbids to provide for summer reliability generation and to provide energy tothe dwr should we produce these documents enron business plans these documents talk in general terms aboutstrategies for developing revenue in california not necessarily forecastsof revenue these documents fall on the fringe of what has been asked forby the subpoena siting generation development documents this is a broadcategory of documents which are irrelevant to the senate investigationhowever if the subpoena is broadly and perhaps fairly read manydocuments within this category may be responsive our suggestion is tocarve out these documents and let the senate committee know that we aredoing so for example dunn asks for information about generation units owned orcontrolled by enron we found documents in which enron controlled thedevelopment of the unit but then sold it to a third party likewise enronis involved in a project to expand las vegas cogen facility many of these documents contain financial data such assupply and demand curves and pricing data in order to analyze whether to goforward with the project we have numerous proposal and drafts but not finalizeddeals in which negotiated to act as scheduling coordinators or to buy theenergy from the facility these drafts are not called for by the subpoenabut documents related to final contracts are we have gathered documents related to negotiations with qfsto serve as scheduling coordinators which apparently coincide withdivestiture by the utilities documents related to meetings of the independent energy producersiep trade association these documents clearly are responsive manyhowever contain sensitive and privilege information including informationabout lobbying efforts thus we need to provide notice to the iep that weare required to produce these documents and give them an opportunity toreview these documents before we produce them additionally we shouldcontact their counsel to see what if anything has already been produced iassume that they have been subpoenaed b enron corp documents in san francisco yet to be reviewedwe have almost completed our review of potentially responsive materialsmaintained in the san francisco office we will complete this review nextweek and produce any additional documents to the repository the followingis a list of the remaining materials to be reviewed electronic documents on sue maras hard drive email messages

delivering boxes to sacramento repositorywe need someone to drive the boxes to sacramento and obtain a key for therepository space bob webb a senior paralegal has volunteered if weneed him to go staffing the sacramento repository we assume that we will need a proctor when the senate committee reviews thedocuments can we work out a schedule or protocol with them moreover wewill need to have someone drive to sacramento each time we producedocuments we cannot simply federal express or messenger the documentsbecause there is no one to receive them confidential stampingwe have not marked

richardbsandersenroncom fergus gary s smith amanda d meringolo peter subject meetings with ees officers in san ramon and costa mesa regarding california ag subpoena we met and talked to ees officers this week on three occasions to identify the documents called for by the ags subpoena that reside within california this memo discusses those three meetings i summary the following people attended these meetings conference call m molland a smith j wright t reilly d van ulden r williams meeting at ees san ramon m molland a smith p meringolo d van ulden t reilly j eastlund m ahad meeting at ees costa mesa a smith j wright t taylor general conclusions it appears that while there may be a large volume of responsive documents in both san ramon sr and costa mesa cm perhaps as much as boxes in each office depending on how broadly we construe the requests for information for eess communications regarding decisions to switch customers back to the utilities there are relatively few highly sensitive internal enron documents which could be used to evidence the alleged antitrust violations or pricegouging however many of the documents may contain proprietary customer information in all of our meetings with ees personnel we emphasized what constitutes a responsive document from a territorial perspective ie only documents in hard copy form in sr or cm or in electronic form on the sr or cm servers it appears that many account managers regularly download and print documents from the document data base housed in houston or the ees intranet going forward it will important to emphasize that in collecting documents for possible production ees personnel should not download from these sources we also emphasized that ees personnel should not currently be physically collecting documents rather they should be assessing what sensitive documents exist locating responsive documents and not deleting or destroying responsive material mojhan ahad and tamara taylor admins assigned to d van ulden and j wright respectively will be coordinating any document production that becomes necessary it appears that a slightly different approach may be necessary to recover responsive documents in sr and cm the account managers in cm appear to have more independence with respect to managing their accounts it may be necessary to speak with them directly in sr it appears that it may be possible to collect the large majority of responsive documents directly from tom dirk and mojhan other than the personnel at sr and cm there are other ees personnel in california that we may need to meet specifically sue mara and jeff dasovich with regulatory affairs in san francisco and several originators in long beach and possibly in northern california who work from home this latter group may be particularly important as they appear to have some account management responsibility on natural gas accounts and most likely have some responsive documents it is unclear the extent to which the subpoena is common knowledge dirk and tom in sr stated that they had not revealed its existence to their staff in cm jim had told his staff about the existence of the subpoena but had not told them who it was from or what it referenced if we proceed with the collection of responsive documents we will need to develop a policy with respect to the confidentiality of the subpoena it appears based on conversations with jim in cm that although general power point presentations are made up for meetings with customers in houston apparently each account manager may change or focus the presentation for a specific customer therefore each presentation will constitute a different document and must be produced separately note on california crisis database golden bear and the dedasr documents these documents are probably the most sensitive but many may be protected on attorneyclient litigation or settlement privilege grounds there are four golden bear team members in california tom dirk jim and george waidelich it seems in sr the golden bear documents are only in the possession of dirk and tom however in cm account managers may have some access to them ii recommendations going forward collect and assess most sensitive documents these would include the golden bear and dedasr documents these should be collected next week in order to begin a legal analysis of privilege issues in sr this collection can most likely be done by mojhan in cm it may be necessary to interview individual account managers meet with floating originators in long beach and potentially in northern california to assess if they possess any responsive documents a brief conversation with the san francisco regulatory affairs people sue and jeff and with george waidelich would also be warranted this should also be done immediately meet with tamara and mojhan to develop a strategy for locating and copying responsive hard copy documents this is underway copy the hard drive folders of key personnel onto cds these folders can then be reviewed for responsive documents by brobeck attorneys if a production becomes necessary assess the extent to which responsive data may reside in archival storage sites eg iron mountain in cm because it may be timeconsuming to retrieve documents from these sites we should know now whether that will be necessary assess the potential implications of the ees intranet on our production obligations begin developing a legal strategy to protect documents that are not privileged but contain confidential proprietary customer information ensure document retention policy for appropriate personnel is in place discussion of specific documents organization and retrieval plan iii mail and data storage generally during our conversation with jon eastlund manager for sr and cm email servers and pete vandegon manager for sr and cm data servers we discussed the email and document retention policies each document has its own server located at its california office email remains on the server until it is deleted by ees user ees user can also move email onto their hard drive and delete from the server every day from monday to thursday a snapshot is taken of the email servers and is preserved on tapes at approximately pm when this snapshot is taken the corresponding day in the previous week is erased and written over therefore at pm on wednesday the snapshot of the previous wednesday is written over similarly each friday a snapshot of the server is taken writing over the friday tape of the previous month in other words there exists at any time a daily snapshot of the past week and a weekly snapshot of the last month therefore if an email is received on a tuesday and deleted on a wednesday that email would appear in the tuesday daily snapshot which would be preserved until the following tuesday but would not appear on the weekly snapshot as of j eastlund is no longer overwriting daily or weekly tapes and is making new tapes going forward he was instructed to keep all backup copies now in existence pete vandegon is sending information via email on the data retention system but as of is no longer overwriting as part of the backup process iv discussion of responsive documents by subpoena document request contracts there will obviously be a great number of these contracts only a few of which are in the public domain and we will need to collect the contracts from both cm and sr as there appears to be little overlap in their files during production it will be extremely important to emphasize to ees personnel not to download contracts from the houston based documentum database the typical procedure forward contracts looking forward personnel in sr and cm are convinced that all of these contracts are housed in houston or housed in california with another enron entity however jim suggested that we check with the floating originators regarding this category forward contracts looking backwards personnel in sr and cm are convinced that all of these contracts are housed in houston or housed in california with another enron entity however jim suggested that we check with the floating originators regarding this category documents sufficient to identify each purchase of electricity or ancillary services sr and cm have no involvement with purchasing and therefore responsive documents would be in houston again however it appears that the floating originators may have some responsive information documents re portfolio of electricity supply sources there appear to be very few responsive documents some customers receive an annual report of the makeup of their power supply eg green power hydro etc but the reports are not particularized they do not list where the hydro came from etc there may also be power point presentations to customers or correspondence with customers about sourcing of electricity documents re electricity purchase risk assessment potentially the golden bear and uccsu documents are responsive here there is at least one power point presentation on the risks associated with relying on the px and possibly other presentations to customers on market conditions documents re strategies or business plans the golden bear documents are potentially responsive but generally sr and cm were not involved in this kind of strategizing documents and communications relating to the dedasr it may be possible to read this narrowly and limit it to documents regarding the decision to dedasr all evidence suggests that this decision was made in houston and sr and cm were not involved read broadly this request and and would encompass a large number of documents including all communications with customers re the decision and possibly a number of power point presentations on the changing market conditions perhaps created by the value enhancement group in houston for categories dirk suggests that we consider whether documents and communications about billing complications would be covered if so the volume of documents increases dramatically see above see above documents re causes of price increases several responsive power point presentations on market conditions internal documents including weekly reports by paul smith from november february and possibly emails relating to uccsu documents re revenue maximizing strategies the golden bear documents are responsive here as well as a few documents in the nature of pitches to clients in cm documents re sales of electricity no responsive documents in sr or cm contracts prematurely terminated it appears that there are currently are none although that may change going forward on the electricity side several contracts may have been terminated but it was due to default by the customer and therefore wasnt premature on the natural gas side there may be prematurely terminated contracts this question should be put to the floating originators note this request goes back to see org charts easy to collect and uncontroversial documents re risk management of trading activities few responsive documents possibly only the golden bear documents org charts risk management see except this request is phrased poorly and we may be able to produce nothing here as the charts have never been organized in the way the ag suggests documents re development of charters and risk management objectives few responsive documents possibly only golden bear documents documents re natural gas positions no responsive documents in cm or sr this question should be put to the originators see iv specific hard copy documents identified in san ramon as potentially responsive backup tapes from email servers for may june and in houston a set of backup tapes from california email servers from december billing documents one binder containing top contracts five cd set dated july containing eemc contracts and correspondence electronic version of documents related to the returning customers to the utilities these documents are on mojgan ahads dirks administrative assistant hard drive in files labeled california rapid response and california strike force these documents include form letters lists of all meters at all customers qas edi forms power point presentation reports of status distributed daily by email created by peter vint originally and mojgan ahad mojgan has emails on hard drive re golden bear this file i believe contains emails sent on behalf of chris holmes ca strike force which contains the reports re return of customers which were distributed to people in houston and california from february to april files related to status of edis re return of customers to pge presently kept by summer intern kerri bernstein original signed documents related to the returning of customers to utilities may be with doug hoth and tom reilly and maybe with other account managers each account manager has hard copy files of documents related to each contract including the contract itself and likely has electronic files containing emails re each account this is based upon my quick review of the files of two managers shawn green and jim kuegle there is no standardized companywide policy about files nor is there a central filing system a few boxes of former account managers however documents related to specific accounts were distributed to the new account managers the hard drives of the former account managers were deleted but mojgan believes that the important emails were forwarded to the new account managers a few boxes from other contracts acquired from pge energy trading current and old organization charts there may be relevant documents located in san francisco especially related to contracts for the purchase of energy v description of electronic documents located in san ramon ees in san ramon utilizes three types of servers mail servers data servers and web servers for the purpose of the subpoena we focused on the mail servers and data servers a mail servers ees employees in san ramon and costa mesa use microsoft outlook on three exchange servers located in california john eastland is the administrator for this server ees employees outside california use lotus notes the lotus notes servers are located in houston tx the retention policy for the exchange servers located in california was as follows each day monday through thursday is copied and saved on a tape for one week each week the tape is overwritten each friday is copied and saved for weeks thus as of yesterday ees had backup tapes for w th m and t and for fridays and apparently a set of backup tapes were sent to houston tx at the end of december for an fcc investigation going forward ees will retain backup tapes for each day until instructed otherwise backup tapes are made at pm email messages that remain on the server at that time are copied email messages that have been deleted or moved onto a persons individual hard drive are not saved currently there is no policy for retaining emails we have told tim reilly and dirk van ulden to retain their emails and to identify any other persons who should do so b data servers electronic documents are maintained on two data servers one in san ramon ees srofs one in costa mesa ees houcm generally speaking documents on the h and j drives appear to be maintained on these servers the it person in houston pete will provide us with the retention policy regarding these two servers ees has windows nt servers and unix servers employees in california access the servers located in houston although it is unclear how many employees do so this much is known mojgan has access to a program called documentum which is an online document storage program located on a houston server all account managers have access to cms customer management system located on houston servers this contains account information service requests information on customer visits etc malcom adkins has access to materials related to marketing located on houston servers if a person leaves california and

projectlevel debt was kw this value reflects fullycontracted cash flow under the terms of the existing ppa as a pure merchant plant the value might range from kw ie the scrap value based on a view that the margins realized from running the plant are insufficient to warrant keeping the doors open to kw based on a view that the plant runs x and achieves prices at levels forecasted by pace global

seeing in todays gas forward markets ie higher prices than pace predicts from an econometrics point of view and at the back end lower overall inflation in general i think its safe to say that we see the spread between ppa and market prices widening especially in light of the fact that current gas market conditions narrow the spread considerably during the period of time in which a brazos breach is most likelybased on the facilitation material weve seen it appears that brazos will argue that its staff was lead to believe that tenaska iv would earn no more than return on equity however weve always viewed this as a somewhat disingenuous line of argument because brazos has gone on public record as saying that it looked at a number of competing solutions to meet its members needs and chose the least cost alternative in contracting with tenaska iv in fact the allin price projections weve seen in correspondence between tenaska iv and brazos in the contracting process appear to be in line with actual results to the extent the project has earned a return in excess of this can generally be attributed to the cost savings realized in construction and strict enforcement of the contract its also important to note that tenaska iv took on all of the development risk in this project it could have easily underbudgeted costs and found itself earning significantly lesssee the historical perspective that follows the forward projections contained in the attached we generally agree that brazos has not been harmed by the current contract to date but is in an abovemarket contract on a going forward basisbrazos appears to have three options at the end of the primary term walk away purchase the plant for pv of future capacity payments or live with the contract by paying scheduled

tenaska ::::::>>>>>> brazos prepared at the request of counsel further to the information feedback provided to you belowitem ive updated page of the attached to illustrate pricing that was presented to brazos and its advisor merril lynch during the period of time leading up to the ppas signing on november youll see that actual results to date have been in line with were costs were expected to be under the contractwe have a one page document that appears to be part of a larger brazos document that indicates that brazos looked at competing alternatives to the tenaska iv plant including one enron alternative the document is datestamped december and may be part of an integrated resource plan or another regulatory filing required in the state of texas robin kittel in our austin tx office is looking into its source and is trying to find any other regulatory filings in which brazos represented that it viewed tenaska iv as its least cost alternative at the point in time it entered into the contract i dont expect well have this information prior to fridaythese points aside there is nothing in the contract that ties pricing or performance to returns realized by tenaska iv the issue of fairness is one that brazos seems to be emotionally attached to without basis under the contractone item to note in the fraudulent inducement arena the last commercial exchanges made between tenaska iv and brazos prior to the june transaction indicate that brazos may have raised some concerns over incentives that may have been provided to the brazos staff closest to the transaction after discussions with tenaska inc and review of the facilitation material weve identified the source of these concerns to be a dove hunting trip that was planned during the summer of and taken november

tenaska ::::::>>>>>> steve ticks restructuring proposal fyi forwarded by dan lyonshouect on am garrick hill pm to charles wardcorpenronenron dan lyonshouectect cc christopher coffmancorpenronenron dan lyonshouectect subject steve ticks restructuring proposalsteve ticks ppa restructuring proposal which we now refer to as the ten points of light is generally as followsthe partnership agrees to amend the interest rate adjustment to capacity charges which effectively lowers capacity revenue by virtue of a lower kwmo charge per steve the modified adjustment should take into account plant capacity use of the term vs construction loan amount and a vs coverage ratio steve also advocates that the loan balance be reduced for the development fee collected by tenaska at close i wouldnt go there as steve has told me on a number of occasions that brazos doesnt know about this feethe partnership agrees to change how the capacity rate is applied he advocates charging the new capacity rate on mw and charging of the new capacity rate on the next mw which effectively lowers capacity revenue by virtue of fewer billing determinantssteves view is that items and need to amount to at least mm in savings to brazos per year more is better mm is a slam dunkthe effects of items and are mitigated by a collecting a higher capacity rate for some period of time after and adjusting energy rates through to recapture marginal energy losses steves advice on these point is that we shouldnt be pigs as i think you know our exposure on point b is greatest when the plant runs at higher levels of capacity which causes us to consume more than dthday without adequate compensation through the ppabrazos purchases the development site for x he likes to use mm which i think is a stretch steve understands that we have a mm termination payment obligation back to the original tenaska iv partners to the extent we wish to convey the development assets but believes tenaska inc would be willing to assume all or a portion of this commitment in exchange for an agreement wbrazos that totally eliminates its officers liability on fraud steve appears to believe this risk is real or he wouldnt make such a big deal out of it he points to the use of the coverage assumption in the interest rate adjustment as clear evidence that brazos made decisions based on an assumption that the tenaska partners would earn only a reasonable riskadjusted return on this project even merrill lynch brazos financial advisor bought off on this provision of the agreement steve is willing to go to bat with both brazos and tenaska on this point to see this to resolution to the extent hes successful and we receive for example mm for the development assets this would be an immediate offset to the capacity payment reductions set out under items and the partnership converts the facility to ewg and per steve shares the benefits with brazos my view is that this could just as easily be done by adjusting the heat rates used for tolling purposes ie after and to the extent applied in the energy pricing used to address his item through the partnership removes distilled water equipment and sells it in the market steve thinks proceeds realized from the sale should be a shared up to with brazos or b used to purchase replacement blades that could be installed during the may outage to prevent summer downtime obviously timing is a key issue herebrazos is granted the right to further reduce its contract payment obligations in ways that are similar to its apache demand charge buyout this is a steve tick soapbox item he uses it as an opportunity to remind brazos that other value has been created during the facilitation processsteve speaks to projectlevel debt restructuring and suggests that brazos be granted the right to affect this restructuring within parameters that are set by the partnership i dont know what to do with this but to say that i believe there is value to restructuring debt at the projectlevel with existing lenders in a way that leaves existing swaps in place inasmuch as we have always planned to take on structurally subordinated debt obligations there is borrowing capacity at the project level since we would need to go to the banks for consents on any of the ppastructural changes advocated by steve it would appear to make sense to tackle debt restructuring on the same pass the banks would love a solution that puts the disputes to rest and should be willing to both consent and lend against the cash flow of the restructured project cobank who has mm of the project debt which amortizes beginning in is one of the banks in the total return swap with kbc by virtue of syndicationsteve also advocates what he refers to as equitable adjustments in effect he would establish a market index against which the allin ppa price could be compared and would have brazos pay a premium over its ppa price to the extent the market price floats above the ppa price i think this is an interesting concept but we cant count on value here more importantly im not aware of a transparent enough price to make this work in ercotfinally steve advocates turning management of the project over to brazos in return for a hell or high water commitment on capacity paymentssteves view is that the hell or high water commitment together with the settlement itself makes ppes partnership interests more marketable im not sure we agree with his view of the risks relative to the overall liquidity of our interests however we need to recognize that hes working with substantially more information than we are at this point from the perspective of what he knows about brazos side of the casemy reaction is that there are things we can work with in steves proposal chris and i are looking at the pricingcost offset details more closely and should have something to discuss shortlydan sorry i missed you yesterday let me know when youd like to place the call to tom moore to update him on the current activity also do you have a sense yet for who well be working with on this internallyhappy trailsrick

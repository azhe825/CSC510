url httpwwwceracomcfmtrackeprofilecfmum recent events in california culminating in new market rules established for the energy and ancillary services markets indicate that legislators and regulators are dissatisfied with the performance of the markets they established the hot weather in california during june triggered high electricity demand corresponding recordbreaking power prices and rolling blackouts in the san francisco area although the economic impact of both the outages and the concurrent price spikes is significant a recent decision by californias independent system operator iso to intervene in the markets by lowering price caps through the summer of from to per megawatthour mwh may prove to be the most important product of the market events ironically the proclivity to continue to change the market rules whatever the intention could create market distortions that delay the addition of new generating capacity by discouraging plant developers and driving away needed capital this would only prolong the states supply shortage and resultant high pricesalthough the recordsetting weather that prompted the rolling blackouts in the san francisco area is not likely to be repeated the west as a whole will experience higher coincident peak demand under normal weather conditions this summer cera expects that supplies will be sufficient to meet peak demand this year but the high price levels of june will be repeated during peak demand conditions not only this summer but during the summers of and possibly the pressure buildsthe blackouts were not spawned by a statewide supply shortfall but instead by a transmission constraint that limits the ability to import sufficient quantities of power to the san francisco area the quantity of generating capacity out of service in the west was near average levels despite a nuclear unit outage in washington although the blackouts were brief and wholesale power prices decreased with the temperatures the intense scrutiny over the events and resultant changes to the market rules indicate that legislators and regulators are dissatisfied with the performance of the markets they designed the markets architects assumed that competition would lower wholesale prices in the state however prices in june have been roughly eight times higher than in s prerestructured california market leading many regulators and legislators to conclude that the markets are flawed requiring additional caps and market rules although some state officials strongly favored lowering the price caps many within the isos board of governors strongly opposed intervening in what they consider to be normal market reactions to tight supply and demand fundamentalsthe current tight supply situation in california and the west as a whole is a product of recent strong economic growth throughout the region coupled with the slow process of permitting new power plants owing to strong economic growth in california in and and percent respectively capacity margins have shrunk from percent in to percent in demand growth throughout the west has reduced the amount of energy available for export from the pacific northwest and southwest to californiaas a result even with optimistic levels of energy imports and the curtailment of approximately megawatts mw of interruptible load within the state california capacity margins will fall well below north american electric reliability council nerc reliability criteria roughly percent this summer the west is the only region in north america that will experience a tightening of capacity margins relative to levels in under normal weather conditions cera anticipates peak demand growth to continue to outpace new capacity additions through with slightly growing capacity margins in at these levels an unusual amount of either plant capacity or transmission line capacity out of service during peak demand conditions would require the iso to mandate blackouts of a portion of the states load to maintain the overall stability of the gridthus the tight capacity situation in the state will continue to pressure prices to high levels which may provoke legislators and regulators to attempt to extend the price caps or implement additional market rulesmarket distorting effectsunder tremendous pressure from some legislators regulators and market participants the california iso board of governors lowered the current price caps on energy from to per mwh in a special meeting conducted june owing to the interconnectedness of western markets the decision to lower the caps and the apparent willingness of regulators to continue to change the rules governing californias electricity markets will affect power market participants throughout the west profitability of existing and future generators degraded high power prices and volatility levels in june although detrimental to most buyers provide strong encouragement to plant developers limiting the level of price flyups degrades the ability of plant owners to recover capital costs plus earn a return on that capital in most periods of the year competition drives prices to levels that provide little opportunity for a return on capital generators therefore seek to recover their investments with higher bids in californias energy and ancillary services markets during periods of supply scarcity existing merchant generators are at increased risk to recover the investments they made based on cash flow outlooks developed prior to the imposition of caps supply shortfall prolonged the process of siting and permitting power plants in california is cumbersome requiring as long as five years from plant proposal to synchronization with the grid the california energy commission cec the state agency charged with approving new plants has repeatedly expressed concerns about the chronic tight supply situation in the state pricedampening market intervention indicates to plant developers that california officials may continue to reengineer the states power markets to the detriment of generator profitability and when added to the difficult permitting process potentially delaying the introduction of new capacity to meet rapidly growing state demand prominent plant developers have recently indicated that markets outside of california may provide a more stable market and a better environment for deploying scarce resources and generating equipment such as turbines trading positions affected lowering price caps reduces the degree of price volatility and the level of overall average prices market participants have executed market positions based on the outlook for prices under the previous higher price cap by lowering the price cap not only are the value of existing physical eg power plant and financial eg forward contracts positions significantly affected but market participants must also incorporate the uncertainty of possible future adjustments to the cap into their trading circumventing market rules the variety of energy and capacity markets in california as well as the bilateral markets outside of the state provides opportunities to circumvent the intent of the new market rules further distorting the markets in the westalthough lowering price caps in california will likely temporarily reduce price levels the new power plant capacity ultimately needed in the state to reduce price levels and improve reliability on a sustainable basis could be discouraged by prolonged and repeated intervention in the marketendfollow url for pdf version of this alertnote

most highly and whichultimately do notthe gas market is also rediscovering the value of firmpipeline capacity particularly into market areas boththe west coast and the northeast have experienced evenmore extreme price spikes with daily prices in bothregions peaking above per mmbtu indeed theshortage of gas in california is so acute that pricesabove per mmbtu have been reported if sustainedthese price levels will induce a political reaction thatwill reverberate throughout the industrystorage updateeven high seems lowpanic in the market yesterday was eased somewhat asstorage withdrawals for the week ending december at billion cubic feet bcf proved to be less thanexpected this withdrawal was half the previous weeksrate and in ceras view actual withdrawals for bothweeks probably lie between these two readings in somecases successive weeks smooth out volatile readings inthe aga survey but even the bcf figure though asignificant retreat from the previous weeks rate ishigh by historical standards one would have to go backto to find a higher reading for a comparable weekin the aga surveyinventories as of the beginning of december at anestimated bcf see table were bcf belowthe yearearlier level and this deficit is likely toincrease substantially during december if weatherforecasts indicating colderthannormal weather throughmiddecember in key heating markets hold true storagewithdrawals for the month will average approximately bcf per day this rate is an increase from cerasnormal weather estimate of bcf per day and eventhis rate depends on weather

weakness of storage inventories and the demandpressure in both core and power generation marketscreated by the cold weather have caused prices to moveonto and even above ceras cold weather path for

colderthannormal weather enduresbeyond middecember or returns on a sustained basis injanuary or februaryseveral forces that could weaken prices during willbegin to enter the market during the winter but theseare offset by demand volatility in the winter and therequirement to rebuild storage inventories once thewinter is over such factors include a building ussupply capability growing imports softening oil pricesallowing a lower floor for prices once the winterends and potentially weakening economic growthalthough the influence of these factors will increaseit is unlikely to match the huge injection requirementthat appears more and more certain next summerdemandthe difficult next round of switchingwith gas prices hitting new record highs cera expectssome additional demand to be priced out of the marketbecause gas has priced above residual fuel oil for mostweeks since may however the easiest fuel switching inthe power generation and industrial sectors has alreadyoccurred even though gas prices are currently above thelevel of distillate approximately per mmbtu innew york switching from gas to distillate requireschanges in longstanding consumer habit will occur onlyover time and is likely limited in volume significantswitching to distillate would quickly raise the price ofdistillate itselfthere are four major sources of additional demandresponse in industrial markets additional switching to resid in industrial boilersthe next increment of demand to come out of the marketis likely to be in the industrial sector throughadditional fuel switching to resid and to some extentto distillate these markets will continue to show someflexibility but will not represent a large volume ceraestimates that the industrial boiler market has probablyalready begun to lose small amounts less than bcfper day in switching to resid given the consistency ofgas price premiums greater than per mmbtu investment in restoring switching capability aspremiums move far beyond this level industrial endusers can be expected to take a closer look atreinvigorating their switching capability beyond theirinitial shortterm levels however such a change wouldrequire investment by industrial end users and theavailability of resid in oil markets cera estimatesthat with focused investment over the course of a numberof months to perhaps a year switching to resid couldeventually reach as high as bcf per day there isalready some movement here given the impact of high gasprices on earnings energy prices have already begun toreceive management attention switching to distillate us department of energy datasuggest that industrial end users have a theoreticalcapability of switching nearly bcf per day todistillate in the short term this switch wouldrepresent additional distillate demand of over barrels per day bd in a us market of millionbarrels this marginal demand would move the distillateprice in tandem with gas price and any additionalswitching among power generators to distillate wouldreinforce this price correlation in addition theavailability of distillate inventories on site shouldrestrict the quick switching to short periods of timeand will not offer a longterm solution to tightmarkets shutting down industrial plants also offering someflexibility is the shutdown of manufacturing plants thatuse gas as a feedstock the major feedstock consumersare the ammonia and methanol industries and notsurprisingly given the tight margins availablemanufacturers of ammonia and of methanol continue toshow suppressed gas demand however in the short termonly a portion of ammonia production is at risk whereasthe production needs of merchant facilities along thegulf coast is relatively readily replaced by importssubstitution becomes more difficult away from the coastbecause of transportation logistics and for facilitieswhose production is linked to valueadded fertilizerproducts hence cera still estimates that even withnonexistent margins substantial ammonia productionwould continue with additional losses of perhaps million cubic feet mmcf per day of potential demand inaddition to the facilities that have already closedextraordinarily high gas prices will also hasten theshuttering of north american methanol capacity puttingat risk another to mmcf per day of gas demandfor that sectorswitching that could occur in boiler use is concentratedin the chemicals paper and

articles ::::::>>>>>> update on ammonia shutdownsterra chemical high prices force chemicals to sell gas futureschemical companies forced to shut in operations because of high natural gas prices are nevertheless making money by selling gas futures contracts terra industries and mississippi chemical corp became the latest companies to announce cutbacks related to current natural gas costs iowabased terra industries said it had sold off a portion of its december natural gas purchases and shutdown of its verdigis ok ammonia facility the company had previously reported that it would not operate its bytheville ar and beaumont tx facilities during the month of december as well in a similar maneuver mississippi chemical corp a producer of nitrogen phosphorus and potassiumbased products in mississippi louisiana and new mexico reported the sale of all of its natural gas futures contracts from january forward in order to take full advantage of the opportunity uncovered by soaring natural gas prices mississippi chemical said it expects to realize a pretax gain of million in its second fiscal quarter ending dec from the recently sold contracts the problem lies in the fact that escalating natural gas costs are not being mimicked by chemical prices an overabundance on the market has kept chemical prices relatively low while gas prices a feedstock for some chemicals continue to climb the difference in the latest shutdowns is that the companies involved have openly announced they have sold their gas contracts off because it is more profitable than manufacturing their products said ron phillips of the fertilizer institute duke energys ken nyiri divisional director of strategic planning and research commented on mississippi chemicals transactions i guess they probably made about a mmbtu margin on the gas which is significantly more than they could make on the ammonia in fact they would have lost unit their ammonia was probably costing them about ton to make with gas bought at mmbtu in november and the market today is at so basically they would break even on their ammonia production costs by selling the gas at around mmbtu they made mmbtu it was just a question of do they convert the gas to ammonia and make nothing on it or do they sell the gas and make million michael l bennett executive vice president of terra said the natural gas price increase since our december requirements were purchased for verdigris permitted us to sell a portion of those purchases and generate higher gross profits than could be realized from selling the products manufactured with the natural gas we will evaluate the economics of bringing verdigris back to full production near the end of december when januarys natural gas purchase commitments must be made terra estimates the idled facilities represent and of the companys north american ammonia uan urea and methanol manufacturing capacity respectively the production of all four chemicals are heavily dependent on natural gas phillips said the latest data we had in october was that of the companies that we survey which is not the entire ammonia market but a good bit of it we were looking at operating rates of currently a total of million tonsyear of ammonia production capacity is out of service out of about million tonsyear of production capacity clearly some of these folks have been selling their gas rather than producing ammonia said nyiri its the prudent thing to do i think in this marketplace buy your ammonia if you can at gas that costs you ton to make the ammonia which is more than the current market is willing to pay a spokeswoman for mississippi chemical said the company held on to its december gas contracts and has been operating at varied levels of capacity throughout see daily gpi june depending on what the gas prices are and what our product prices are around the januaryfebruary time frame we will make decisions then on our operations rate capacity said melinda hood a mississippi chemical spokeswoman charles o dunn ceo of mississippi chemical said we remain committed to the nitrogen business and our customers but we also have to take advantage of opportunities to optimize cash flow during these challenging times it is our belief that the current unprecedented natural gas prices are unlikely to be sustained during the intermediate term stated dunn as a result we felt it was in the companys best interest to sell our futures positions to lock in the substantial gain afforded by the recent increase in natural gas prices going forward we will continue to determine operating levels for our plants based on the relationship between natural gas prices nitrogen product prices and our customers requirements as we have been doing for some time international imports are also hurting us producers currently there is a surplus of ammonia in the international market which is holding ammonia prices down us fertilizer producers cant compete with the international market gas prices are centsmmbtu in russia cents to mmbtu in argentina and venezuela and mmbtu in trinidad the us imports million tons of ammonia each year fertilizers represent of the demand for ammonia in the united states terra industries said its facilities would resume production as soon as it became economical again whether from gas prices declining or nitrogen and methanol prices rising just as long as prices reach levels allowing positive cash flows nyiri said he believes relief is in sight he pointed out that the ammonia market has been sitting around the ton level for the last several months but believes ammonia prices will have to increase entering the next planting season ive got my model peaking out around ton in april or may and at that time i have

pressure remains extremely strong in the united states gas market as three factorsincreasing power generation demand lower storage inventories and us wellhead supply still struggling to reboundcall into question the ability to build storage to a level adequate for next winter as strong as gas market fundamentals are gas prices are being supported also by concurrent strength in oil and liquids markets making traditional alternatives to gas much more expensive than in recent years in this environment intense competition between power generation demand and storage injections will continue throughout the summerwith pressure increasing into july as temperatures riseand gas will continue to price at the high levels necessary to discourage enduse demandthe per million british thermal units mmbtu increase in gas prices since the beginning of may has already driven responses among end users first gas is now pricing at a slight premium to residual fuel oil on the east coast and gas will likely lose approximately million cubic feet mmcf per day of demand to residual fuel oil this summer relative to last summer second several ammonia manufacturing facilities have begun to shut down equally telling however is that heat in any one region of the countrymost recently the westis all that is required to sustain gas prices above at the henry hub despite relatively moderate temperatures elsewhere and demand reductions in industrial and other power markets underlying pressures are such that prices are likely to rise on average from current levels as higher temperatures arrive for these reasons cera expects prices to average at the henry hub during july see table and even greater volatility is possible the intense competition and need to price out enduse demand mean that the market is vulnerable to spikes above per mmbtu amid heat waves this summergas storageinjections increase but little relief yetthe gas market experienced a small measure of relief in early june as storage injections finally reached a pace closer to historical averages with the american gas association aga reporting billion cubic feet bcf of injections during each of the weeks ending june and however these injections did little to reduce a deficit that is now close to bcf on a yearoveryear basis and conditions may not again be as favorable as they have been recently for injections for many weeks or even months to come as temperatures rise through the end of the month injections are likely to slow so that for june cera expects an average injection rate of approximately bcf per day the deficit that stood at an estimated bcf as of the end of may see table on an inventory level of approximately bcf is expected to rise slightly during june to bcf despite a healthy injection rate for the first nine days of the monthwith us wellhead supply still running an estimated to bcf per day below yearearlier levels and with added imports from canada just offsetting this decline even the moderate demand growth expected for july relative to last july will make reducing the deficit a difficult task each month in which this bcf deficit carries forward increases the likelihood that inventories will be at their lowest maximum ever this october injections like those in the recent two weeks would have to continue into july for this pattern to reverse in a significant way an unlikely event that would occur only under very mild weather conditionsregional marketswith the exception of the rocky mountains western differentials have been supported by waves of hot weather and extremely strong gas demand for power generation within the region this strong demand is pulling supplies from the permian and san juan basins to the west coast and has pushed up capacity utilization on the southwest pipelines into california prices at the california border have been particularly strong averaging over a premium to the henry hub so far this month continued strong western demand looks likely to support prices within the region through july as power loads remain strong and hydroelectric output declines in addition the early heat waves have begun to erode the california storage surplus although inventories in the region as a whole remain strong see table ceras outlook by region follows rockies continuing strong supply growth and low seasonal demand have pushed up exports out of the rocky mountains region high utilization rates on export pipelines will keep rocky mountain differentials wide during the rest of the summer cera expects an average july differential to the henry hub of per mmbtu san juan the pull on supplies from california has narrowed the differential between the san juan basin and the henry hub and this west coast pull looks likely to remain strong through the summer cera expects a differential between the san juan basin and the henry hub of per mmbtu during july permian and midcontinent as texas power loads increase the competition from the west coast and texas markets for permian supplies should intensify permian differentials which have been averaging around per mmbtu to the henry hub should narrow cera expects a per mmbtu differential for july midcontinent supplies should price just below permian supplies at an per mmbtu differential to the henry hub chicago chicago differentials continue to trade around per mmbtu to the henry hub and although hot weather and climbing demand within the region could put some upward pressure on those differentials ample seasonal pipeline capacity into the region will limit pressure cera expects a july differential of per mmbtu northeast new york citygate differentials have a higher floor this summer namely higher fuel costs from the gulf coast as a result of gas the result has been differentials above from transco station but closer to from the henry hub as power generation load reaches its peak however differentials can rise even in summer shortlived power load peaks may lift weekly new york differentials into the s but for the month of july cera expects the new york differential to average canadian marketsdemandstill downcanadian demand continues to be down on a yearoveryear basis volumes on transcanada pipeline are mmcf below levels at this time last year and alberta demand is mmcf below both of these reductions are primarily storage related weak storage injections driven in large part by the lack of an adequate summerwinter price spread continue to place inventories further behind levels although inventories are still well above the fiveyear average unless injections increase it is more likely that endofseason inventories will be comparable to the fiveyear average bcf rather than to levels bcfexport volumes continue to be slightly higher than last year thus far in june flows on northern border pipeline are similar to while pge gtnw is currently operating mmcf higher demand on the west coast is expected to continue this trend for the summeralberta supply build for june is likely to be flat with levels an outage pattern similar to last years has emerged tcenova has had maintenance projects ongoing in june but the supply reduction is primarily the result of plant turnarounds thus far in june reductions in supply because of maintenance have been as high as mmcf but should average mmcf for the month even though june is expected to be flat yearoveryear the fact that this maintenance reduction is less than maintenance reductions implies that a return to supply growth has not yet occurred supply is still expected to start showing growth in the second half of the year largely in the fourth quarter as a result of the increased level of drilling the annual average supply is expected to be around mmcf per day higher than in as the result of the return to growth in alberta and modest growth in british columbia again primarily later in the year as well as the new production from ft liard that is now onstreamthe nymex

httpwwwceracomcfmtrackeprofilecfmum a strong dose of summer weather in june propelled westwide demand levels up by nearly percent over the same period in these higher demand levels provided the years first example of the power price spikes that can be produced when the wests tight capacity intersects with normal summer load levels lowerthannormal hydroelectric levels strong gas prices and californias immature wholesale power market structure as power markets reacted in june with unprecedented price strength throughout the region regulators and the california independent system operator iso intervened to dampen markets from a maximum of per megawatthour mwh to per mwh although some market participants have filed protests at the federal energy regulatory commission to raise or eliminate the caps utilities legislators and consumer advocates are moving to protect consumers or completely redesign what they perceive as a flawed marketas western markets move through the critical julyaugust peak electricity demand period market participants and regulators alike are wondering if power supplies will be sufficient and if price levels will rival those in june cera expects that western supplies will be adequate under normal summer weather conditions barring abnormal unit and transmission line outages however normal august weather conditions will push demand levels significantly higher than in june creating an even tighter supplydemand balance straining the ability of the transmission system to supply key demand regions adequately a hot weather event could exhaust both instate and imported supplies for californiathe tight supply and demand situation will almost certainly prompt a strong price response similar to that in june this will fuel the unease of regulators in states that have restructured their markets and in those that are considering restructuring even as regulators continued support of restructured power markets begins to waver a weather event that forces regional blackouts would force regulators to interveneceras outlook for august power markets is driven by high peak loads under normal weather conditions westwide august loads will be on average megawatts mw higher than last august the peak load in california is expected to push capacity margins to percent even after curtailing interruptible load lower hydroelectric output as the west enters its peak load period hydroelectric production is expected to decline systemwide by roughly average megawatts amw from july to august compared with the high sustained output of last august hydroelectric output this august although roughly average on a historical basis will be roughly amw percent lower high levels of gasfired generation compared with august higher utilization rates along with gas prices that have climbed per million british thermal units mmbtu will increase the incremental cost of energy production by over per mwh although cera expects power prices in august to diverge from production costs owing to the expected supply tightness higher production costs will create a higher floor for energy prices in all periods of the daythe extremely tight power supplydemand balance within the west and within california specifically has resulted in unprecedented high summer gas demand for power generation this high demand levelcombined with seasonal storage injection needs in californiahas pushed up utilization rates on pipelines into california and pushed topock differentials over per mmbtu to the henry hub strong demand should continue through august in the west and support premium pricing at topockthe rocky mountains represent the opposite extreme to the high premium placed on topock deliveries in the rockies supply is building relative to export pipeline capacity and market access is becoming a challenge weak seasonal demand compounds the problem the strong western demand for gas for power generation does not extend to the rockies generation within the region remains nearly all coalfired these regional pressures should remain a feature of western gas markets through septembermoderate summer weather and reassuring injection rates nationwide during recent weeks have allowed some easing in prices at the henry hub however summer is not yet over and absolute storage inventories are still at critical levels higher gas prices are likely to resurfaceregional power market driversaugust demand under normal weather is expected to rise by an additional percent or nearly amw over average june levels see table peak demand levels should exceed those in june as well with a coincident peak over the whole western systems coordinating council wscc of mw expected under normal weather conditions in a percent increase over the weathermuted peak california alone should experience peak loads that are approximately mw higher than peak levels in juneavailable generation capacity in the west has been at normal levels for this time of year although coalfired plants are responding to a record production year with repeated but shortlived outages the steady decline in hydroelectric generation will remove amw from the west resource base when compared with july levels and about amw since june although reservoir refilling operations temporarily removed significant quantities of hydroelectric generation during portions of june given hydro operators economic interest in maximizing onpeak production at the expense of offpeak production the loss of capacity during the onpeak period will be lower than these levelsaugust will be a critical month for the heavily importdependent state of california while the state will be drawing approximately amw of imports during august to meet demands during peak periods cera expects the level of imports to exceed mw during peak demand conditions the southwests need to supply native demand first will limit its ability to export to california and lower yearoveryear hydroelectric

supply for the pacific northwest has declined to percent of normal levels for the lower columbia owing to warmerthannormal weather in june in addition normal seasonal decline in runoff levels will drop about amw from the resource base when compared with levels in june see table generation plant operators have responded to both growing native demand and a robust export market by running coal and gasfired generation at high levels although less than mw of gasfired generation is currently available in the region it has been running at high utilization rateshigh energy demand in california for pacific northwest energy will keep differentials low between the regions as in june pacific northwest prices will respond in kind to the volatility cera expects to occur in california in august in addition if hot weather in the pacific northwest pressures regional energy reserves local prices will rise to keep energy in the region potentially causing prices in the pacific northwest to move higher than those to the southcaliforniacalifornia is entering the peak load season with relatively little generating capacity down for maintenance although hydroelectric output continues to decline statewide reservoir storage levels remain high at roughly percent of normal nevertheless declining hydroelectric production is expected to remove about amw when compared with hydroelectric production levels in junenormal summer weather will push demand in the state up by about amw over june levels which were high see table californias peak load is expected to exceed mw compared with a peak load in june of approximately mw mw on the states iso system alone according to its own estimate assuming normal plant outage rates this demand level will necessitate the import of about mw of energy to meet the statewide peak even after curtailing the approximately mw of interruptible load available for tight supply situations the state has a precarious percent capacity margin during the system peak an extreme hot weather event could push state loads up by an additional mw outages are likely if additional imports are not availablea capacity limit of mw will be in place during the summer for energy exports from the pacific northwest to northern california the import limit from the pacific northwest to southern california will be mwrockies and southwestaugust demand levels in the combined rockiessouthwest region will increase only slightly above levels in august climbing approximately amw as loads in the regionunlike the rest of the belowaverage wsccwere near normal last august even so august loads will increase demand by over amw when compared with levels in june of this year as with last year and this june supplies in the region should be sufficient to meet peak demand conditions under normal weather although growing loads in the rockiessouthwest region have reduced its ability to supply neighboring regions with energy during peak demand conditionshigh loads driven by hot weather will keep the regions prices high differentials between the region and california will be tight but california having tighter supplydemand balances will need to price at a premium to attract energy the highcapacity transmission ties between the rockiessouthwest and the california market which is about percent the size of the rockiessouthwest market will ensure that prices in the rockiessouthwest stay close behind california prices whenever loads are high in californiaregional gas market driversevidence of pipeline bottlenecks has emerged across the west and supply and demand forces over the next year look likely to intensify these pressures since the northern border expansion in late narrow northsouth and eastwest differentials across pricing points defined the market this summer the continuing supply growth in the rocky mountains has widened differentials between the rockies and the rest of the west at topock increasing gas demand in california and high utilization rates have resulted in high premiumsoverall in north american gas markets strong storage injection rates in recent weeks have allowed some easing in pricesfrom an early july henry hub price of per mmbtu to under per mmbtu however despite these high injection rates the supplydemand balance and absolute level of storage inventories remain precarious summer is not over and higher nationwide power loads in weeks to come will likely cut into storage injections and boost prices the ongoing competition between power and storage for supply should support an average henry hub price of per mmbtu in augustthrough the end of the summer differentials in the west should hold near current levels the pressure of growing rocky mountain supply will continue until heating loads start climbing in the fall in california high seasonal power loads should continue through august with hot weather and continued declines in hydroelectric generation demand strength is expected to continue across the west august demand for gas should climb from billion cubic feet bcf per day in june to bcf per day buoyed by an increase in gas demand for power generation see table californiahigh gas demand for power generation within california will continue through august cera expects an increase from the states june demand levels of bcf per day to bcf per day during august the increase stems from declines in hydroelectric generation and increases in overall power loads total demand is expected to exceed last years demand level by bcf per day this will increase flows on pipelines into california reduce the states storage surplus and sustain high prices cera expects pipeline utilization rates during august to average percent see table cera expects an august topockhenry hub differential of per mmbtu see table pacific northwestdespite the extremely high prices at topock and high demand in california until recently gas at malin priced at a slight discount to henry hub prices after averaging per mmbtu below the henry hub during the third quarter last year the differential so far during the third quarter this year is per mmbtu below the hub this week malin is pricing at a per mmbtu premium relative to the henry hub the topockmalin differential has swelled to over per mmbtu signaling intracalifornia pipeline capacity constraints two factors pressured malin differentials during the early summer pressure on rocky mountain and aeco differentials prices in the two areas supplying the pacific northwest are under some pressure increasing supplies in the rockies are beginning to reach the limits of export capacity and put downward pressure on rockies prices by limiting external market access at aeco although export capacity out of the province is available almost all of that excess capacity accesses eastern canada on transcanada pipeline pipelines into the united states are running near capacity because of transcanadas limited ability to discount interruptible transport the available space is more expensive and therefore the last to be filled low early summer regional demand gas demand in the pacific northwest is limited during late spring and early summer by declines in heating loads and very strong hydroelectric output even in a normal or dry hydroelectric year seasonal runoff holds down gas demand for power generation in may and june even as gas demand for power generation begins climbing in california increasing power loads are already evidentthe first factor will likely endure until heating season begins in late fall and regional demand in the rockies and western canada begins climbing however gas demand for power generation in the pacific northwest has increased already this summer and will continue to climb through the end of july and into august as hydroelectric generation wanes this added demand million cubic feet mmcf per day above june demand levelswill provide some support for malin prices and limited support for rockies and aeco prices malinhenry hub differentials are expected to average per mmbtu above the henry hub price during augustrocky mountainspressure on regional supplies within the rockies continues as exports out of the region reach new highs differentials to the henry hub have widened to over per mmbtu and although prices in the rest of the west will gain some support from high power loads regional demand in the rockies is expected to remain near low seasonal levels through august august demand is expected to average bcf per day in the region approximately equal to junes bcf per day total demand demand begins to build during september but until the heating season begins in october rocky mountain prices will lag well below prices in the rest of the west cera expects a rocky mountainhenry hub differential of per mmbtu during augustalthough some narrowing in rocky mountain differentials looks likely as seasonal demand increases through the fall the rapid build in supply in the region will likely keep differentials wide during cera expects a supply build this year of nearly mmcf per day followed by a build of over mmcf per day during currently approximately mmcf per day of excess pipeline export exists out of the region with the largest increment on transcolorado into the san juan basin next summer all capacity will likely run close to full until export pipelines expandthe first likely expansion is trailblazerdifferentials will remain wide for cera expects an average annual differential below the henry hub of per mmbtusouthwestdifferentials in the san juan and permian basins have gained considerable strength relative to henry hub prices amid the recent hot weather in texas permian supplies are pricing at a slight premium to the henry hub price and in the san juan basin prices have narrowed from an early july differential of per mmbtu to a differential of less than per mmbtu cera expects demand in the southwest during august of bcf per day an increase from junes level of bcf per day but the larger texas market will determine the relative strength of differentials in those two basins cera expects a san juan differential of per mmbtu during august with a permian basin differential of per mmbtudifferentials between the rocky mountains and the san juan basin have widened substantially over the past two months with supply increases in the rocky mountains flows on transcolorado increased from a monthly average of under mmcf per day to over mmcf per day during june supply in the two regions is following opposite paths rockies supply is climbing rapidly and san juan supply has likely peaked and should decline slowly beginning this year cera expects a decline in supply of mmcf per day during

articles ::::::>>>>>> cera western markets july forecast forwarded by lorna brennanetsenron on pm webmasterceracom on pmto lornabrennanenroncomcc subject new peaks new prices cera alertcera alert sent fri june title new peaks new pricesauthor zenker moritzburke snyderemail category alertproduct line western energy url httpwwwceracomcfmtrackeprofilecfmum in the west july typically marks the start of the summer cooling season which along with waning hydroelectric energy production and the more frequent use of gasfired generators to meet demand causes steadily rising power prices cera expects the west to be the only region in north america with a yearoveryear increase in peak electricity demand power prices already established new record highs in june suggesting that as demand reaches its peak during the coming summer months western power markets will continue to experience increased volatility compared with last years levels the convergence of natural gas prices that are much higher than last years levels growing demand for power and reduced hydroelectric energy production when compared with levels in is pushing up western power prices merchant and other gasfired generators will be pressed into service experiencing their strongest utilization rates since the drought year of greater utilization of gasfired generators within the west has supported western differentials and contributed to high gas prices throughout north america western gas prices should continue to be strong boosted by continuing increases in regional gas demand for power generation and pressure across north america to inject gas into storage in anticipation of summer power loadsthe main drivers of higher power and gas prices when compared with yearearlier levels will be peak wscc load season summer weather will drive loads to the years coincident peak which is most likely to occur during the julyaugust period but could arrive any time during the june through october airconditioning season cera expects demand growth of percent in the third quarter compared with levels in which will push western systems coordinating council wscc coincident peak demand levels to percent over levels waning hydroelectric output hydroelectric production is on its normal downward seasonal slide this resource decline is more visible when compared with the hydro season which was both abundant and prolonged high utilization rates for gasfired generators growing demand for electricity coupled with a declining availability of hydroelectric energy will drive utilization rates of gasfired power plants to their highest levels since the drought year of higher fuel prices western gas prices have remained at per mmbtu above levels growing yearoveryear gas demand for power generation is providing much of the price pressure in western markets these higher gas prices provide a boost to both onpeak and offpeak power prices of between and per megawatthour mwhregional power market driverspower markets in the west are poised to break records for demand peak load and gasfired plant utilization and as a result power pricesa return to normal summer weather coupled with growing demand for power will push demand for electricity up by gigawatthours gwh in the us west for the third quarter compared with levels or almost megawatts mw on average see table this growth in the demand for electricity will also drive peak loads to new highs cera expects the wscc coincident peak to be exceeded by percent climbing to nearly mw as was demonstrated by the mild summer of deviations from normal weather could boost or thwart this peak demand growth figuretwo key factors will significantly reduce third quarter hydroelectric production levels compared with levels first cera expects westwide total season hydroelectric production in of roughly percent of historical average levels substantially lower than the approximately percent of average in second runoff was prolonged in serving to push a substantial portion of the hydroelectric production into the summer period see figure on average cera expects these factors will remove gwh or almost average megawatts amw from the western resource base compared with levels exacerbating this decline refilling of reservoirs and flow restrictions to assist fish migration will cause periodic but significant curtailments in power production at key pacific northwest hydroelectric facilitiesnatural gasfired facilities will be called upon to supply most of the expected increase in demand while also replacing hydroelectric resources as they continue to decline this will push average annual utilization rates of gasfired combined cycle steam and cogeneration plants to approximately percent in levels not experienced since the percent annual average utilization rate in a year marked by drought and warmerthannormal summer weather utilization rates for these facilities will also surge past levels especially this summer cera anticipates a westwide third quarter utilization rate of percent for these facilities under normal summer weather conditions compared with percent for the same period of this level of utilization will certainly establish gasfired generation as the floor to power prices during the third quarter during not only the onpeak demand period but the offpeak as well with natural gas prices at per mmbtu higher than levels power prices are boosted by per mwh owing to fuel price increases alone with supply tightness already evident in western power markets the stage is set for increased price volatility compared with levels as episodes of hot weather require increased utilization of lessefficient generators throughout this summerpacific northwestthe water supply forecast for the columbia river remains near average but has dropped a couple percentage points from last month flows are expected to remain at roughly percent of average through september on the lower columbia and percent of average on the upper columbia conditions overall are still sufficient to be considered average this return to normal conditions in the pacific northwest should produce hydroelectric output nearly gwh percent lower than last year for july and gwh lower for the third quarter as a whole see table the regions load growth coupled with lower hydro supply will continue to elevate power prices in the pacific northwest relative to levels tighter supply conditions in california and the southwest will attract energy exports from the pacific northwest preserving a differential between the pacific northwest and california of about per mwh on averageprice differentials between the pacific northwest and california have varied dramatically recently with the north at times rising above those to the south owing to local demand and hydroelectric constraints caused by reservoir filling operations since the end of may volatility in both markets has pushed the difference between daily onpeak prices at cob and those in california from a premium of per mwh to a discount of per mwh within a few days cera expects that over the long run california markets will clear at a premium as the summer progresses but the differential will vary widely with episodes of pacific northwest power pricing at a premium to those in californiacaliforniadespite belowaverage precipitation and snowpack this year california reservoir storage levels throughout the state are higher than normal ranging between and percent of average for the states primary runoff regions under these conditions hydroelectric output should be roughly percent gwh below last years levels for the third quarter see table with a return to normal weather conditions relative to third quarter cooling demand this summer will increase most in california where weather was nearly percent cooler than average last yearrecent dayahead power prices in california have drawn attention to the west as the highestcost market if only temporarily in north america record high temperatures and unscheduled unit outages produced new dayahead price records with power prices on june at per mwh in the dayahead onpeak market and realtime hourly prices at the market cap of per mwh increased utilization of gasfired generation and daily gas prices of around per mmbtu burnertip in southern california have kept daily average offpeak prices between and per mwh notably these higher price have occurred during periods when roughly mw more coalfire generation was available in the west compared with the same period in cera expects prices to continue to respond to the tight capacity environment this summerrockies and southwestduring summer the rockiessouthwest was the only region to experience aboveaverage cooling demand suggesting that normal weather should bring only moderate demand growth of less than percent see table however growing energy demand in neighboring regions and a large transmission transfer capability will pull energy from the rockiessouthwest region when excess capacity is available ensuring that prices in the region will remain tightly connected to price levels in other parts of the westpalo verde prices have generally kept pace with other western markets while maintaining their characteristic premium to the california power exchange during spring and early summer cera expects southwest prices to strengthen relative to california when summer weather periodically shifts the locus of demand to the southwest however california prices will maintain a premium on average to those in the southwest as the effects of the states tight supply situation translates to higher prices than those in either the southwest or pacific northwestregional gas market driversunder continuing pressure to inject gas into storage in the face of declining supply and increasing gas demand for power generation gas prices at the henry hub are expected to average per mmbtu in july the strong demand for gas for power generation will keep differentials strong in the southern half of the west in the rockies pipeline constraints will keep differentials widethe heightened call on gas demand for power generation driven by the declining hydroelectric generation and increasing power loads is expected to drive demand increases of bcf per day relative to july and mmcf per day relative to june demand levels gas demand for power generation is expected to reach a monthly average record level of bcf per day in july see tables and these increases will result in declines in western storage injection rates and in exports from the west both permian and san juan supplies will be pulled increasingly toward the west coast during julylow storage inventories and needed increases in injections are driving north american gas pricing the west is the one us region actually running a storage surplus but the recent heat waves and associated pull on gas supplies have eroded that surplus particularly in california see table given the expected increases in gas demand the western surplus should continue its decline this decline and very high demand will reinforce the volatility in differentials already evident this summercaliforniabecause of the early hot weather in the west and strong gas demand for power generation topock prices have been extremely high and volatile so far this month topock has averaged over per mmbtu above the henry hub flows on el paso and transwestern into california increased by over million cubic feet mmcf per day during june relative to may averages and flows are expected to continue to climb by an additional mmcf per day during july pgt continues to run near capacity see table at the same time the storage levels within california look likely to fall below last years levels sometime during the monththis intense demand pressurecalifornia demand should increase by nearly mmcf per day in july relative to junewill keep utilization rates on import pipelines high and sustain topock differentials cera expects the topock to henry hub differential to average per mmbtu during july see table this high differential will likely persist through the summer with differentials rising above per mmbtu during west coast heat wavessouthwestsan juan price differentials have been volatile narrowing during periods of very high western demand however a very high utilization rate on pipeline capacity into california has widened the topocksan juan differential and that wide gap is expected to persist on average san juan differentials to the henry hub are expected to narrow from current levels as southwestern demand increases with western temperatures demand in the southwest is expected to climb from bcf per day in june to bcf per day in july this increased call on regional supplies and an expected strengthening in permian prices should result in an average san juan differential to the henry hub of per mmbtuin the permian basin prices are expected to strengthen as texas power demand climbs combined with the pull on supplies from the west permian differentials should narrow from their current levels of per mmbtu to below per mmbtupacific northweststrong june hydroelectric output has limited the call on gas supplies in the pacific northwest so far this summer but as hydroelectric output decreases in june and july gas demand will increase dramatically cera expects an increase of nearly mmcf per day during july relative to june levels the limited demand so far has meant differentials between malin and the henry hub of as much as per mmbtu and topock to malin differentials of over per mmbtu the malin to henry hub differential has narrowed slightly to around per mmbtu it should continue to strengthen with growth in regional demand and average per mmbtu during julyrocky mountainsregional gas supply within the rocky mountains continues to increase bolstered by continuing growth in the powder river basin this april exports out of the rockies reached bcf per day a record high although there is excess pipeline capacity out of the region into the southwest on the transcolorado and northwest pipelines high utilization rates have widened rockies differentials with the rest of the west in particular rockies to san juan differentials have averaged nearly per mmbtu for june after pricing close to parity earlier in the year that gap should persist through the summer as gasfired generation climbs across the rest of the west demand is expected to average the same level in july as in june in the rocky mountains where coal limits gass gains in power generationcera expects prices within the rockies to gather some support from increasing power loads in the pacific northwest as well as from stronger differentials in the san juan basin on average rockies differentials to the henry hub are expected to average per mmbtu during julyin response to the increasing supplies flowing out of the powder river basin and the increasing pipeline capacity utilization on export pipelines trailblazer has announced an open season for two possible options to extend and expand the mile pipeline from wyoming into nebraska although timing and volumes have yet to be announced the additional capacity could prevent serious bottlenecks from developing out of the region which cera would expect by without

articles ::::::>>>>>> california on the brinkcera alert forwarded by lorna brennanetsenron on am webmasterceracom webmaster on pmto cc subject california on the brinkcera alertcera alert december title california on the brink cera knowledge areas western energy n american power n american gas california on the brink the california stalemate california moved closer to the brink of an outage today as concerns over creditworthiness of buyers brought the possibility that generators would avoid selling to the california market while numerous factors have contributed to the high cost of power incurred by californias utilities the root cause of the current crisis is a lack of new generation the current credit crisis and its threat to supplies could spark state action to address the situation the collective efforts of all market participants should be focused on increasing generation capacity as quickly as possiblewestern power prices have skyrocketed well beyond the record levels set this summer perhaps because frozen rates insulate the majority of california consumers and companies from tangible effects of the market crisis regulators have been able to postpone meaningful market reforms and significant rate increases the california public utilities commission denied the requests of pacific gas electric and southern california edison to end their rate freezes forcing these utilities at least temporarily to finance the costs of higher wholesale energy this has created an unsustainable accumulation of costs and a loss of faith in the california market the current credit crisis and the potential for blackouts may become the galvanizing events that provide state regulators with a public mandate to address the underlying structural problems in the industry however there is no guarantee that these regulatory actions will expedite an effective solution for customers and the industry as a whole wholesale and retail markets that emerge from regulatory intervention are likely to remain muddled in the necessarily political process that will follow it is possible thatas has largely been the case so farthe steps taken will fail to move the california power market toward a more enduring solution and will instead continue to mask the underlying structural flaws in the six months since californias supply shortfall began plaguing western markets regulators have done little to address the underlying problem rather than addressing the cause of the supply shortageestablishing a market environment that encourages timely additions of new generating capacity and demand side responsesefforts are instead directed at trying to lay blame for the crisis and lessen the immediate financial impact on customers indeed several actions taken thus far have served more to compound the problem by discouraging new power plant additions these include price caps repeated changes to market rules attempts to seize generator profits and a challenging siting and permitting processmedicine worse than the illness several years of electricity demand growth and low prices in california were accompanied by very few additions to the supply base regulators did not pay adequate attention to the looming supply shortfall the void of consensus over the cause of the current crisis has instead been replaced by a series of bandaid remedies that address the symptoms but not the cause of californias electric market woes challenging siting and permitting despite state action to better coordinate the siting and permitting process for new power plants power plant developers still face high hurdles local community opposition alone has struck down some key proposed facilities price caps discourage investment state and federal proposals to cap prices limit the attractiveness of the california wholesale power market especially for developers who have the option of channeling scarce capital and equipment to more stable or more attractive markets outside the state repeated rule changes frequent rule changes in the iso markets including the price caps confound attempts by developers to estimate profits from new plant development calls for refunds despite reports by the power exchange the iso and the ferc that no pattern of abuse could be found from their examination of the california markets state officials continue to accuse power providers of gaming the market calls by state officials for refunds of generator profits are a threat to new plant development facility inspections recent inspections of power plants by state officials to verify that operators are honestly reporting the operational status of their generating units accentuates the atmosphere of mistrustceras recent analysis suggests that merchant plant developers in the west are not guaranteed to make a profit prospects of new plant profitability are affected by the timing and quantity of new plants decommissioning of older units demand growth and numerous other difficulttoforecast factors californias regulatory actions only further cloud the assessment of financial viability and degrade the political environment for developers considering entering the state despite efforts by the california iso to stimulate new capacity additions in the state with a special limitedterm capacity payment cera estimates that demand growth will continue to outstrip supply additions in the west in in addition the existing siting and permitting process will prevent a sufficient quantity of capacity from entering the market until at the earliest therefore three years remain before a sufficient quantity of capacity enters service to significantly dampen prices and decrease the risk of an outage the road to recovery there are a number of actions that can be taken to help relieve the capacity shortfall encourage new build supply must be part of the answer this requires a series of steps that can help facilitate new supply build while in principal some have been taken such as new fast track approval the success of these actions can only be measured by the build itself for now there is still not enough new supply coming on until to relieve supply tightness stabilize investment climate utilities must have assurance that they will ultimately be allowed to recover market costs for power this provides the credit worthiness needed by sellers to produce energy and to stimulate new build move toward more balanced utility supply portfolios one of the reasons the pressure on customers has been so intense in california has been the absence and even discouragement of diverse supply portfolios among the utilities in the stateparticularly for residential and small commercial customers with the market at a peak however now is in one sense a suboptimal time to move toward term contracting yet these contracts provide the foundation for a series of actionsincluding new supply build and demand side investments if they end up above market they will at least have achieved the desired effect of knocking down prices a fact which by itself should provide sufficient justification for recovering the cost of these commitments encourage market mechanisms that elicit a demand response although originally a feature of californias market design most consumers are insulated from price spikes through capped or frozen retail rates exposing customers to at least some of the market price signals would encourage a demand response encourage market mechanisms that dampen the boom bust characteristic of the market whether in the form of a capacity payment a reserve requirement or a minimum term portfolio requirement the california power market needs to move to a structure that encourages investment in new capacity when the market is in balance rather than waiting for a shortage and price shock to elicit new investment such a structure can help dampen but not eliminate future price volatility avoid continuously tinkering with the market while the market does need to be restructured as described above it also needs to be stable and reliable to encourage the development of new supply as well as a robust longterm contractual market for power in california continually tinkering with the market structuresuch as the three times the price cap has been shifted since julyonly serves to undermine confidence in the market california needs to do its best to develop a longterm solution and then let the market run its course allow for greater environmental flexibility the state should explore a more balanced solution to emissions restrictions in the face of a supply shortfall that has been exacerbated by generators that cannot operate due to emissions restrictions free purpa power plants to generate relief should be granted to purpa power plants that are operational but are restricted by contract from operating to generate only power end this cera alert will be available in pdf format within hours this electronic

venture of royal dutchshell group and bechtel enterprise holdings inc closed a deal yesterday giving the international developer a equity interest in houstonbased coral energy one of the largest natural gas and power marketers in the country coral energy officials had predicted in july that shell and construction giant bechtel would fold intergen intergen north america and certain assets of coral energy into one business see daily gpi july under the agreement announced yesterday intergen will receive the majority of the natural gas pipeline storage and power generation assets of shells coral energy affiliate in the united states it remains a joint venture of shell and bechtel the move gives shell a ownership in intergen with bechtel owning the remaining intergen had been formed as a joint venture and bechtel made an undisclosed payment to shell in the deal about coral employees mostly related to the texasbased assets in houston will become intergen employees under the agreement intergen is considered a world leader in power generation development with projects around the world carlos riva intergens ceo said that the transaction represents a significant boost to our plans in the united states these assets and strengthened alignment with a premier us gas and electricity trading enterprise will provide intergen a strong platform for growth in the us market globally the alignment is expected to help leverage shells strengths in both fuel supply and power marketing and trading bechtel will continue to be intergens preferred provider for worldwide power generation engineering procurement and construction services coral is the regions third largest natural gas marketer and the twentieth largest power marketer in the country linda cook shell gas and powers ceo said the whole idea was to help intergen grow in the united states and that the best way was to add shell assets to it success in tomorrows energy markets will be earned through globally aligned marketing trading and asset companies said cook thats critically true in the us and will be the case as competitive energy markets open worldwide intergen plans to build a sizable power generation portfolio in the us working closely with coral to pursue investment decisions that make the most commercial sense we expect this relationship to make a significant contribution to both intergens and corals longterm success shell and bechtel formed intergen in march see daily gpi march specifically to pursue power generation opportunities in north america the bostonbased company was set up to develop shell bechtel and intergen have among them the complete skill set for success in the new global energy market said paul unruh coo of bechtel intergen is a worldclass developer with a proven track record of successfully developing financing and operating projects around the world shell is one of the most successful marketers and traders of energy in the us and is expanding into deregulating natural gas and power markets globally bechtel is a global leader in the development engineering and construction of power facilities these strengths together create a large power generation platform now directly linked with global energy marketing and trading intergens portfolio will give coral energy access for its trading business and coral will participate as part of shells global trading network with intergen a business partner in its expanding north american asset platform as the exclusive marketer of shells gas production coral has a gas supply of bcfd and a trading platform dealing in extensive volumes of energy in all key supply basins for bechtel the agreement will help it lock in construction contracts for its combined cycle gas turbine power stations specifically the assets to be transferred to intergen from coral include the following miles of major intrastate gas pipelines in texas the pipeline facilities extend from south texas near the mexican border along the texas gulf coast to the louisiana boarder and north from near houston to the east texas producing areas the west clear lake storage facility one of the largest natural gas storage reservoirs in texas located near the houston ship channel it has a leasehold interest in the stratton ridge storage facility corals interest of more than mw in four power plants one in operation and three under construction the transfer would follow equity and regulatory approvals in total coral had miles of gas pipeline that ran along the gulf coast in texas and louisiana it also is building a mile long pipeline in northern mexico with that countrys national oil company pemex currently intergen is either operating or building power stations with a total of mw it also has mw in advanced

sell exclusively through the california power exchange calpx and clears the way for bilateral contracts in the forward market ferc scheduled a settlement conference for dec in washington of parties in the states power market to negotiate those contracts california does not have the benefit of a competitive market chairman james hoecker said noting he had heard the states power market called crisis by design the design was an unworkable state law the product of command and control that described in detail exactly how the market should function it wasnt competition hoecker said its time to get serious about saving the future of competitive marketscompetition did not fail in principle at either the wholesale or retail level because it was never wellconceived or tried this version of competition was a disaster commissioner william massey defended the federal energy regulatory commissions backing away from price caps rather than cap the spot market created by the state of california the order would simply shrink its size and diminish its influence this will give back participants ability to find the right price this ability is what california has taken away from that market massey said the action would allow bilateral transactions support forward contracts and allow the parties to manage risk he urged the california public utilities commission to step up to its responsibilities in supporting the fercdirected activities massey said the transfer of wealth in what he described as the apocalypse in california is absolutely staggering the two largest utilities are virtually bankrupt he predicted a court acting on accepted law and precedent would eventually rule the utilities are entitled to recover the costs from customers spreading the costs out over the entire state pge corp officials lambasted the commissions actions saying they left californias electric customers exposed to price gouging and future electric supply reliability uncertainty the california wholesale market is broken and we are extremely disappointed by the insufficiency of todays ferc order pge officials said in a statement the remedies outlined in the order do not go nearly far enough to provide a solution that ensures reliability of the states electric supply and equally importantly provides relief from future price gouging the northern california utility company said pge said it was particularly disappointed that ferc did not call for retroactive price refunds for california electric customers as was requested by gov gray davis the utility also said it was especially troubled that ferc shortened the timeframe for the electric price cap from the end of to april leaving customers exposed during the highdemand summer season sen dianne feinstein dca said fercs action was unacceptable rome is burning our utilities are close to bankruptcy californians are facing major blackouts and the commission is fiddling hoecker said similar competitive problems in states in the pacific northwest have led to pleas from governors and others for regional price caps but he pointed to the fact that ferc is severely limited in what it can do in that region for one it lacks authority over the bonneville power authority and other federal operations there which make up a major portion of the market further there is no northwest spot market that can be capped in the way caps operate in california there also would be problems with the many purchasers who already had hedged or protected themselves in some way hoecker strongly urged energy secretary bill richardson to convene a conference to try to identify regional problems and offered his help in this commissioners curt hebert and massey said they would issue concurring opinions hoecker said he will submit a concurring opinion next week on items such as rtos that are beyond the scope of the order the commissions actions which went beyond recommendations it had made earlier see daily gpi nov came at an emergency meeting following a week of continuous power alerts and emergency measures to avoid rolling blackouts in the state the commissions reforms call for no retroactive refunds for california customers elimination of the requirement that californias three investorowned utilities pacific gas and electric san diego gas and electric and southern california edison sell all of their power into the calpx and buy all of their power from the calpx this took effect friday return mw of generation to state regulation termination of the calpx wholesale rate schedule effective the close of the

can be in place by may a singlepriced auction to be used only for bids at or below mw bids above mw will not set the market clearing price although they will be subject to ferc reporting requirements replacing the current caliso stakeholder governing board with a nonstakeholder board on jan the caliso governing board members will be required to turn over their decisionmaking power and operating

articles ::::::>>>>>> maybe tw should build into northern nevada check this article out shippers condemn northwests mustflow ofosseveral northern nevada industrial gas users have accused northwest pipeline of violating its tariff by holding them hostage to the daily mustflow operational flow orders ofos that it has issued since early december in an effort to compensate for the sizable capacity shortfall on its system in a section complaint filed friday the industrial gas customers called on ferc to direct northwest to cease and desist the alleged violation of the tariff which they claim is forcing them and other customers at the northern end of the pipeline to subsidize the gas acquisition and transportation costs of customers on the southern end of northwests system the effect of the mustflow ofos is to compel shippers to make up the capacity shortfall on northwests system via displacement the industrials noted northwests firm contractual demand is dthd but its physical capacity is only dthd panalberta gas us inc provides dthd through a displacement arrangement while shippers are left to make up the remaining dthd the industrial users contend they shouldnt be penalized for not complying with the mustflow ofos because northwests tariff exempts shippers that have made good faith efforts to obtain gas supply but have been unsuccessful at issue is whether the good faith efforts applies to purchasing gas at reasonable costs which is how the industrials interpret the tariff or whether it means that shippers should be required to buy gas at any price to meet a mustflow ofo the latter according to the industrial users is northwests position the regulatory history of northwests tariff makes clear that good faith efforts to obtain a gas supply at the stanfield or receipt point need not extend to purchasing gas at any price but rather must be viewed in the context of current conditions and circumstances ie available prices and supplies the industrial customers said where a shipper can secure gas needed to meet a mustflow order only at the basin price differentials that currently prevail and assuming that the shipper can document such efforts and impacts for northwest verification the shippers request for exemption from penalties must be granted northwest twice has refused such a request by the industrial customers they noted in anticipation of the high gas prices this month the nevada industrial users said they chose to switch to alternative fuels where feasible or to curtail operations rather than use their released capacity on northwest nevertheless the pipelines daily mustflow ofos have forced them into the volatile daily gas market to avoid extremely high noncompliance penalties undermining their business decisions to rely on alternative fuels they told ferc rp in order to comply with northwests orders the industrials said they must ship the gas to a point where they cannot use it and can only sell it at the rocky mountain basin prices which is a fraction of the price at which under current conditions they purchased it the industrial users said they have had to comply with northwests mustflow ofos given the hefty penalties they would face otherwise the penalties are equal to the greater of dth or four times the highest spot rate at sumas stanfield kingsgate opal or ignacio for the month of noncompliance based on the spot rate at stanfield the penalty this month was dth if one of the nevada industrial users newmont mining corp had defied northwests order to flow of its contract demand or dth on any december day it would have been penalized for that one day they said if all of the nevada industrial customers had violated the pipelines order the oneday penalty would have been the industrial shippers want ferc to go beyond interpreting the good faith efforts exemption in their favor they contend that northwest tariff allowing mustflow ofos as currently structured is both unreasonable and unduly discriminatory thats because it requires one group of shippers who see no additional benefits to incur gas acquisition and transportation costs solely to subsidize service to another group of shippers they argued they believe the shippers who benefit should pay for the displacement capacity costs currently the mustflow ofos result in southbound flows on northwest that create northbound capacity for the benefit of shippers with southtonorth entitlements those same southtonorth shippers could however themselves purchase spot gas in the canadian supply areas and ship such volumes southward on an interruptible basis on northwest ie do what the industrial shippers and others have been directed to do they could pay the costs of the capacity that they want as an alternative northwest could require a sharing of displacement capacity costs by all shippers using its system at a given time when capacity is short or it could invest in facilities so that it has the physical capacity to meet all of its contractual commitments the industrial users said

by extending emergency orders requiring gas and power suppliers to continue supplying the cashstrapped utilities the emergency gas order now expires at am est feb in granting the extensions abraham urged the state to get to work to solve its own problems he said only california can implement the policies necessary to resolve the shortterm and longterm supply challenges our action today is designed to give the governor the california legislature and other relevant parties the time to take necessary action i strongly urge the parties to act immediately said abraham he also said he was keenly aware that other western states have expressed concerns about their own supply situation and the impact the order is having on power prices in their areas despite the action pge said it still is having trouble getting gas suppliers to comply with the emergency order originally issued jan the gas supply situation is not good utility spokeswoman staci homrig said yesterday afternoon we are quickly depleting our storage even under the order j aron co a subsidiary of goldman sachs has not delivered gas they represent about of our daily needs bcfd in january oh yeah weve been in contact with them she said weve been in contact with the doe too the other two suppliers who had stopped delivering gas to us last week have made gas available to us under the order they are sempra energy trading and western gas resources homrig said pge expected doe to take legal action against those who didnt resume deliveries the order applied to gas suppliers all of which supplied gas to pge within the last days theres not a lot i can say said j aron spokeswoman kate baum j aron has always complied with the law and we intend to comply with this order thats my statement i can neither confirm nor deny anything else meanwhile other suppliers who were not among those on the does list were staying as far away from california as possible all i know is were not selling in california any more a person could get fired around here for doing that said one marketer all we had in california were a few spot deals that expired at the end of december needless to say we didnt reup them without the does order pge would be back where it was last week with some suppliers stopping delivery others planning to stop at the end of their contract terms and most suppliers unwilling to sell additional gas to the utility pge has said it has enough gas in storage to make up for the lost supply under such a scenario until the first week in february homrig said pges storage currently is well below full or less than bcf and depleting rapidly by about mmcfd to bcfd pges pipe ranger web site shows the utility has been averaging about mmcfd of withdrawals over the past several days and is expecting a slight increase over the next few days ca launches new buying program supplies remain tightdepending on your perspective california either moved toward future solutions to its nagging energy crisis or took several steps backward yesterday with the launch of its electricity bulk buying program for longterm fixedprice supplies the auction began yesterday and will run through noon today the state is seeking sealed bids for sixmonth threeyear fiveyear and year supply agreements whether results of the auction would be made public was still unclear yesterday but the results are expected to be given to legislators who now are debating various longterm solutions in the state senate a spokesperson in the state assembly speakers office said the legislature is basically standing by awaiting more price information action on the proposed comprehensive legislation including the question of the state taking over the private utilities hydroelectric systems should come by the end of the week merrill lynch said yesterday it was increasingly skeptical that the securitization for hydro plan would go forward it has received muted support merrill lynch said and has not been drafted as a bill yet recent revisions of the comprehensive bill show some progress on contract flexibility with the possibility that the value of the entire portfolio of energy contracts might be capped at a weighted average price of mwh which is well below the utilities retail rate caps edison at mwh and pge at the difference is expected to be used to pay down the utilities debt meanwhile the electric system limped along under the specter of another stage three yesterday but without rolling blackouts and elsewhere indications outside the state were that some energy marketers have written off california from their prospective marketing lists were not selling in california any more a person could get fired for doing that around here said one texasbased gas marketer referring to the continuing credit problems of pacific gas and electric co which has been hobbled by the weight of its wholesale electricity debts on the natural gas side too in the meantime southern california edison co is back in federal district court in los angeles where it obtained a favorable initial ruling two weeks ago this time it is asking for the court to force the california public utilities commission to allow it to raise its rates to cover the wholesale cost of power calling the action with the court a last resort edison said it has tried to get the rate situation resolved but at every turn it has met resistance denial and fingerpointing by the cpucs fivemember governorappointed board the cpuc on tuesday acted to anticipate new state legislation regarding the hydroelectric systems in the state by canceling hearings it had scheduled this week and next to go exclusively to written comments for the environmental review of the ongoing case looking at pges hydro utility assets the current energy crisis in

low cost of gas supply and the prevalence of co al fired generation mw or percent of the installed base in the region ceras outlook for onpeak average price for february is p er mwh offpeak prices in the rockies will drop nearly per mwh below the southwest reflecting the ability of california markets to exert more influence on the southwest than on the rockies western gas markets although gas prices at topock have come down from lofty december levels winter is far from over in the west indeed the pressure is intensifying the cre dit crisis precipitated by the power market crisis is spilling over into gas markets storage levels within california are again at critically low level s the mild weather during december and early january allowed some improvement in the positions but when pges suppliers began refusing to serve because of the utilitys credit problems the utility responded by drawing heavily on s torage inventories and a spell of wintry weather compounded increased demand in t he face of limited supplies as a result overall inventory levels are again falling quickly cera estimates that inventory levels in california are approximately billion cubic feet bcf a continued heavy draw on gas for power generation will k eep demand levels high see table and the inability to manage demand spikes by drawing on storage inventories leaves the market exposed to price spikes normal weather during february would probably allow prices at both topock a nd malin to settle back into the to premium to the henry hub but extreme weather could push basis differentials as high as per mmbtu in the rockies and san juan basins differentials will depend critically on the weather because supply levels and storage inventories in the rockies are healthy the impact of swings in regional demand can cause wide swings in differentials cera expects the swings to continue through february with differentials generally maintaining wider discounts to the henry hub by the end of the month as high absolute gas prices continue more and more effects of these prices will emerge cera estimates that mmcf per day of base industrial demand in the westparticularly in californiahas switched off of gas some end users have turned to diesel fuel for industrial boilers some plants have simply curtailed operations in response to the higher prices on the power side plants within california are extremely limited in their ability to burn alternative fuels because of emissions credits however plants outside of california do have some backup capability arizona public servic e has purchased barrels of sulfur residual fuel oil to burn as an alternative to gas given the intense pressure on gas oil will absorb some of growth in power loads california in november an early strong draw on storage in california raised questions about winter deliverability within the state a combination of low storage inventories high gas demand for power generation and continued high utilization rates on import pipelines into the state will keep pressure on california prices through february see table despite efforts by end us ers to limit gas burns in the state in the face of extremely high gas prices c era expects demand during january in the state is up by mmcf per day on a year overyear basis in february loads should start to decline as residential and commercial demand declines through the month however power loads will rem ain strong and actually climb from january into february as hydroelectric generation falls this demand support continued strong capacity utilization rates in import pipelines into california and critically low storage inventories will keep intense pressure on gas prices within the state through february during periods of high demand prices will likely reach back up into the to per mmbtu range eventually as heating loads settle and storage dra ws slow toward the end of february differentials should ease back into the to per mmbtu range on balance cera expects a topock differential fo r february of per mmbtu see table pacific northwest three factors have combined to strengthen malin prices over the past week and these forces should extend price strength at malin into february first th e return of colder winter weather after moderate temperatures during late december and early january is increasing heating loads and power loads

loads offset continued increases in gas demand for powe r generation however prices at malin will likely remain unusually strong th is spring part of the shortfall in hydroelectric generation continues to be made up by draining reservoirs that early drawdown will limit the availability of hydroelectric generation through the spring and early summer months both l ow hydroelectric generation and a challenging storage refill season in norther n california should sustain the malin premium to the henry hub even into the spring rocky mountains the volatility in rocky mountain differentials continues differentials continue to depend primarily on local heating loads cooler weather support s loads and prices within the region but periods of warm weather drive steep declines in rocky mountain prices relative to prices at the henry hub duri ng february demand should drop off in the region although declines in heatin g loads in neighboring western regions will be offset by increases in gas dem and for power generation the rockies remain primarily coal based as a result the lower expected hydroelectric output will do little to support loads within the region increases in supplycera expects supply increases of mmcf pe r day during relative to will overwhelm available pipeline capacity out of the region demand during february in the rockies is expected to remain flat at bcf per day however within the month demand loads will drop substantially this w ill put pressure on differentials toward the end of the month and cera expects average basis differentials to the henry hub during february of per mmbtu that widening trend should continue during march with differentials to the henry hub eventually reaching per mmbtu this summer southwest prices in the san juan basin have been following rocky mountain prices up a nd down with regional demand loads that dynamic will likely continue through february cera expects relatively flat demand during february within the southwest as in the west as a whole a significant dropoff is expected during march as residential and commercial heating demand wanes for february continued strong demand loads within the rockies and southwest will support prices in the san juan barring unusually warm weather cera expects a differential to the henry hub of per mmbtu as residential and commercial loads decline sharply during late february an d march prices in the san juan will reflect ample supply cera expects decli nes in san juan production during but declines will be limited by the strongest drilling activity for conventional supplies in the basin in a decade however pressure on rocky mountain supplies will mean increased exports fr om the north into the san juan and those increased exports will more than off set the declines in local production pipeline capacity constraints out of the san juan will again mean wide san juantohenry hub differentials with pressur e on prices developing during the spring and intensifying through the summer months western canada increasing supply aeco differentials to the henry hub have ranged between per mmbtu and over per mmbtu given strong demand in the united states export pipelines have been running near capacity all winter even the bcf per day alliance pipeline has been running full through the end of the winter continued strong us demand should keep export pipeline flows near capacity given these flow levels cera expects differentials to remain near the to per mmbtu level reflecting the cost of transport on transcanada the only available export capacity out of alberta for february cera expects a differential between aeco and the henry hub of per mmbtu storage inventories in western canada are running below historical average levels but the refill season should be manageable inventories are nowhere near as low as us inventory levels inventories in the west are expected to fall slightly below historical average levels by the end of withdrawal seas on and exports should decline relative to first quarter levels as injection season begins in the spring cera expects differentials to henry hub prices to nar row sometime in the late spring as

articles ::::::>>>>>> daily california update cpuc votes to keep gas flowinga special session yesterday of californias regulators gave pges utility authority to amend its gas supply deals to keep supplies flowing to the state past feb when the current federal doe emergency order expires but it postponed action on another pge request that southern california gas co which has strongly objected be compelled to provide emergency supplies to the pge utilitys residential and small business customers loretta lynch president of the california public utilities commission said pges utility is a victim a victim of circumstances and a victim of predatory practices by natural gas suppliers now demanding payment for future supplies up front not because the utility has failed to pay its past gas bills but because the electricity crisis has sapped its creditworthiness the cpuc action allows pges utility to offer suppliers the option of securitization or in effect a lien in the utilitys retail customers bills which cover the full cost of the wholesale gas prices as an incentive to have the suppliers extend contracts with pges gas utility operations while the creditworthiness of the company itself is dubious it wont be until next week when the utility begins negotiating new contracts that it will know if the cpuc action will overcome the suppliers reluctance to extend contracts in the current situation according to pge gas utility spokesperson staci homrig on the operational side pge on wednesday declared a lowinventory ofo because of a cold snap causing more supplies to be burned then pipeline shippers were bringing into the system the action was thought to help cause the pge citygate price to jump from to on wednesday as for reports of low storage homrig said that while the utilitys supplies are very low they are adequate for the next week they are not dipping into cushion or base gas at this point homrig said lynch said that pge has not defaulted on any payments but nevertheless in what she considers predatory practices the suppliers have required advance payments or payment at the time supplies are provided these gas suppliers are taking advantage of an emergency situation to extract another pound of flesh lynch said in voting for the securitization measure suppliers who have been paid when due are now saying regardless of existing agreements pay us today they are doing this in the coldest time of the year so the commissioners have to take these difficult steps to allow pge amend these agreements in order to keep the gas flowing part of the cpucs action places a day limit on the securitization option so with the way gas contracts work in effect it only provides about another days worth of supplies said homrig who noted that almost all of pges to suppliers have asked for special payment arrangements advances cashondelivery or letters of credit that the company cannot accommodate because of its cashflow crisis out of ongoing negotiations the parties came up with the securitization proposal in the customer account receivables thus assuring them they will get paid on the gas side pge has had sufficient revenues unlike its electric business but the suppliers have not wanted to let the utility stick to a normal payment arrangement because of the severe creditrating decline in the past weeks the cpuc met in san francisco late wednesday afternoon in the midst of a whirlwind day of public announcements from the governor state legislature consumer groups regulators and utilities a key piece was missing however california state legislative leaders called off a morning briefing that was to have offered the latest legislative proposals for dealing with the energy crisis reportedly sticking points remain centered on the key questions of who pays for the solutions and how deeply the state gets into the energy business a spokesman for the assembly speakers office said he had no idea when the briefing would be rescheduled one piece of legislation that got through the state senate sb x yesterday authorizes another million in emergency funds to purchase power it also would allow the state water resources department to be the utilities wholesale power supplier under longterm contracts at least through the measure drew a protest from cpuc commissioner richard bilas who argued that the state agency be removed from that role as quickly as possible the bill which was first passed by the state assembly was returned to assembly committees last night to iron out changes made in the senate it then would have to be ratified again by the assembly meanwhile consumer activists held rallies around the state protesting the state bailout of the privatesector utilities this prompted at least one of the utilities southern california edison to come out swinging saying that the recently released results of utility financial audits do not show any windfall profits or diversion of monies from the utilities to the parent company a letter surfaced in washington from gov gray davis to the senate energy and natural resources committee dated jan and outlining measures the state is taking to increase energy supply and decrease demand sign longterm contracts and maintain the financial viability of the states public utilities the letter a catalogue of recent initiatives already reported here contained no

would be online by the end of the year responding to questions on another arena edison internationals senior vice president tom higgins said everything is on the table in the ongoing negotiations

of energy that varies between and megawatts mw depending on the time of year time of day and utility plant availability the utilities most recently performed this function themselves buying energy from the california power exchange px however cdwr has been buying electricity o n behalf of the ious since midjanuary when the nearbankruptcy of southern california edison sce and pacific gas electric pge threatened to disrupt supplies to their customers cdwr is a state agency that manages water reservoirs and transportation systems in the state cdwr uses an enormous amount of electricity to transport water across california and provides critical loadshedding capability to the independent system operator iso in addition cdwrs reservoirs generate power the cdwr is thus well integr ated in the states electric grid but in the past has not executed large compli cated energy purchase arrangements to supply the customers of californias utilities portfolio of transactions the intent of ab is to allow cdwr to execute a portfolio of contracts to stabilize the cost of power for the utilities and their customers cdwr has until january to execute contracts cdwr will take title to power and is thereby not just acting as a clearinghouse it has issued a request for bids and seeks a variety of terms including month ly annual twoyear threeyear and longer cdwr may also enter into options thus although cdwrs role is intended to be temporary the contracts th at it executes could extend many years power for munis cdwr may purchase power on behalf of some california municipal utilities at the municipal utilities election new payment scheme cdwr will be entitled to a portion of existing utilit y rates to pay for the cost of purchased power interest on bonds and administrative expenses this payment stream will be equal to the differenc e between the generation component currently embedded in utility retail rates averaging about per kilowatthour kwh and the utilities costs to run their own generation plants costs of bilateral and qualifying facility contracts and the costs of ancillary services the cdwr share of retail ra tes is referred to as the california purchase adjustment cpa it is not clear whether the cpa will cover wholesale power market costs current prices for multiyear power contracts may lie above the cpa in addition if investors believe that the cpa is inadequate to cover costs the entire program may b e abandoned new bonds bonds will be issued to secure power the total amount of bond s issued may not exceed four times the cpa the state will transfer mill ion from the general fund to jumpstart the program which begins immediately this seed money and all bond proceeds must be recovered by cdwr from the califor nia utilities customers and municipal utilities if they opt in new residential rate freeze the california public utilities commission cpuc is prohibited from increasing residential customer rates until it ha s completed paying all outstanding obligations this locks in the recent percent residential rate increase indefinitely governor gray davis thus ke eps his pledge not to increase rates further retail competition to help secure a stable payment stream for the new bonds ab enables the cpuc to prohibit the utilities retail customers from choosing an alternative electricity provider until cdwrs obligations are paid although the cpuc has yet to act on this the action would effectively halt the competitive retail markets in the state for the duration of the cdwr progra m taxpayer protection ab directs that the new bonds clearly state neither the faith and credit nor the taxing power of the state of california is pledged to the payment of the principal of or interest on this bond thus the bonds are secured only by the payment stream from utility rates no assets affected the cdwr is granted neither ownership nor control of utility assets ironically the authority now granted cdwr is what california utilities had essentially requested last summer when they sought to stabilize electricity prices by executing a portfolio of transactions the utilities were never provided sufficient authority to execute term contracts in addition the utilities have more experience to perform this function than cdwr rather than aligning retail rates with wholesale electricity prices california has sidestepped the issue by simply transferring the electricity purchasing function sce and pge are still left to contend with uncollected costs fro m past energy purchases although they will no longer incur costs associated with buying power in the current wholesale market while charging frozen retail rates the utility liquidity crisis has not been resolved it is not clear whether the laws prohibition on rate increases for residential customers can be achieved the law is silent on rate increases for commerci al and industrial customers providing a potential path for recovering higherthan expected costs alternatively cdwr could conceivably find contracts of sufficient duration and low enough price that the rate pledge is met these contracts would lock in todays retail rates for a long period of time ab is just one of the steps that state officials hope will restore the po wer system in california to a more stable footing key tasks remain californias wholesale market structure which helped cause the supply crisis by ensuring that it was not profitable or possible to build generation in california remains unchanged the term contracts cdwr is likely to sign wi ll provide a mechanism for mainly existing generators to lay off risk but will not be sufficient to encourage the build of sufficient new facilities in addition californias siting and permitting process remains largely unchanged the state must still address the need to expedite the development of new power plants ab does not provide for the recovery of uncollected past wholesale ener gy costs of californias utilities the state has been negotiating a deal w ith the utilities that may involve the transfer of generation or transmission asset s to the state however the utilities have achieved recent court victories that may pave the way to a courtdirected recovery of these costs recent audits indicate that sce and pge recovered their stranded costs early in wh ich should have triggered an end to their respective rate freezes a legal showdown between the utilities and the state on this issue may be inevitable end follow above url for full report come shoot the rapids with us at ceraweek shooting the rapids strategies and risks for

articles ::::::>>>>>> check out these good contacts note there are a lot of good names and organizations in this article especially the economic development councils worth spending some time with themlorna wednesday february nevada goes for the goldby dave todd dtoddftenergycom mailtodtoddftenergycom its a reverse twist on americas economic history one might even call it a case of eastward hofor the first time in the nearly two centuries that california has been part of the united states entrepreneurs are talking about leaving not moving into the golden state because of potential opportunities for doing business to the east not much farther east only over the mountains into neighboring states but still in that direction as opposed to jurisdictions north or south of california and the biggest lights in the eyes of one particular industry are emanating from nevada jack stewart president of the california manufacturers and technology association recently warned that massive power price increases and future rate hikes could be the genesis for industry departures from the state the impact on large industrial users he warned could provide an impetus for a statewide economic downturn in california which accounts for about of the united states gdpcalifornias mass exodussince the beginning of the year nevadas primary economic development agencies have been overwhelmed by california companies wanting to relocate some or all of their operations to the state the bad news for california is that the list includes many silicon valley enterprises or wannabes whose growth planning units have been gripped by uncertainty about the dependability of future electric supply deliverysomer hollingsworth president and ceo of the nevada development authority in las vegas said in late january he was urgently asked to meet with corporate officials of a major california company to brief them about relocating to nevada in meeting with the company he asked are there others like you and they said yes we can introduce you to company after company after company overwhelmingly it is hightech california companies that are most interested in moving because of their evergrowing requirements for reliability in their electric service beyond that we have five power companies that have already come down here and talked to uspower producers he said these companies including calpine corp are keen to take advantage of a variety of opportunities made easier by the fact that unlike california nevada has no state income tax and no general corporate or business inventory tax putting it at both a geographical proximity and tax advantage to california it also puts nevada ahead of other lowtax western states such as arizona colorado and utah renosilicon valley share symbiotic relationshiphollingsworths northern counterpart at renos publicprivate sectorbacked agency the economic development association of western nevada edawn tells a similar story chuck alvey who heads that body says interest in his city from silicon valley refugees is becoming intense a mere threehours drive and minute plane ride from the san franciscosan jose area reno and lake tahoe already house hundreds of hightech industry executives who commute back and forth and who have up to now escaped the impact of power drains caused by their energyintensive industries server farms banks of computers that manage web sites and related business operations continue to grow in number a single server farm can require as much as mw of power to operatestrict new federal energy efficiency standards to curb demand by other power hogs such as residential central air conditioners and heat pumps clothes washers water heaters and commercial heating and cooling equipment wont be implemented in time to affect the current power crisis the us department of energy last month announced that the energy conservation measures could save consumers and businesses more than billion over the next years though the energy saved would eliminate the need for mw of new power generation the new standards wouldnt be phased in until between and stan thomas director of business planning and growth strategies for sierra pacific power co nevadas dominant energy company said his business has experienced great success at moving silicon valleybased firms divisions into nevada albeit in a limited way but were seeing a lot more companies saying wait a minute we cant operate here anymore with power being shut off and having payrolls to meet and not producing any product he added that getting a little more aggressive about enticing electricity supplyconstrained companies to relocate to nevada is no longer likely to be seen as a cherrypicking operation at another states expense in fact nevada froze its electric deregulation planning last year pausing to reconsider its options as a direct result of californias policy confusion we have delayed until we have a plan together where capacity exceeds native instate demand said thomas sierra pacifics power delivery capabilities are being enhanced by its plan to build a new kv line in eastern nevada to import power from utah in it also installed a major line into the pacific northwest both developments are significant because the company has switched its strategy to become more of a power transmission distribution company than a generator were learning our lesson here said thomas setting aside the issue of burgeoning energy demand requirements across the west the need to recover stranded costs associated with deregulation is a preoccupation for power plantowners in general he said as for california i think the next couple of years are going to be some tight times no doubt about it and thats why what were trying to do in nevada is secure longterm contracts as well as shortterm contracts to protect our customers while were in the process of securing capacity to ensure that we have an adequate supply of electricity at reasonable rates other areas targeting california companiesits not just nevadas physical proximity to california that helps it attract relocating companies its also the different opportunities offered by nevadas two main population centers reno and las vegas both cities attract different kinds of energydependent businesses from california in this regard we are two different markets said thomasin any case nevada isnt the only state thats getting calls and returning interest in kind half a continent away tennessees state department of economic and community development recently targeted about california companies with financial enticements and advertisements that proclaim the lights are always on in the electric powerrich tennessee valley authoritys service territory elsewhere across the nation from seattle to manhattan there are initiatives to build or refurbish buildings to make them capable of servicing highenergy demand internetrelated data centers nevada however has one giant advantage aside from being closer to california las vegas for example has one of the most extensive readily accessible black fiber systems of any major metropolitan area in the united states but of course it would as the nevada development authoritys hollingsworth joked most everything we have here is stateoftheart and brand new because we blow everything up every years we just implode it and build something new the most recent casualty to fall to progress was the el rancho hotel on the las vegas strip deemed past its prime which bit the dust in october in a televised entertainment

north american gas url httpwwwceracomcfmtrackeprofilecfmum alternative urlhttpwwwceracomclientnagaltnagaltabhtmlgas prices remain within a high range with prices volatile between approximately and per million british thermal units mmbtu prices are likely to remain within this high band through the fall until the uncertainty of early winter weather resolves itself at the lower end of this rangeand with oil prices in the upper s per barrel or higherprice support kicks in as end users begin to switch back toward gas or to reactivate industrial demand gas prices may flirt with the lower boundary so long as the weather is not too hot across too many regions allowing storage injections to increase and providing hopes for an adequately supplied winter abovenormal heat in only one or two regions however or even the threat of storms in the gulf of mexico will pull prices quickly upward as for the upper boundary although prices in specific regions such as california and the northeast may reach above an actual storm in the gulf or more widespread heat than has yet occurred this summer appears required to pull the henry hub much above absent tropical storm activity in the gulf of mexico cera expects prices to settle into the lower portion of this band during september see table although strong power loads and the resulting weak injection rates are likely to sustain prices through much of august the seasonal decline in generation demand into september should allow storage injections to increase by billion cubic feet bcf per day as a result cera expects prices to settle somewhat averaging per mmbtu at the henry hub during september however the larger fundamental force in the market remains unchanged supplies are adequate with any certainty only for another warm winter any interruption in supply or abnormal demand will quickly drive prices upward next month may represent the low for the remainder of the yeargas storagenot yet enoughmild weather over much of the united states during july allowed a muchneeded recovery in storage injections with the estimated injection rate increasing by nearly bcf per day from yearearlier levels see table this rate was enabled entirely by lower demand however and not added supply the result is that under more normal summer weather conditions during august the us storage inventory deficit is likely to remain stubbornly near bcf although the deficit is likely to decline on average during august it is even more likely to expand again during september especially should any storm necessitate evacuation of offshore platforms absolute inventories and supply adequacy for this winter therefore remain a concern in the marketinventories are unlikely to reach levels adequate to prevent record lows from occurring next spring should injections continue as expected inventories would reach approximately bcf by october but reaching even this level still an alltime low annual maximum inventory requires some help from a lack of storm activity and a lack of heating load in october storage inventories are not yet sufficient to relieve market pressure and are unlikely to become so by the beginning of the heating seasonregional marketswestern disconnects continuewide differentials emerged this summer in the west and look likely to persist through september in southern california record summer demand levels have pushed pipeline flows to new highs topock continues to be the premium pricing point in north america in the rockies supply growth has pushed up pipeline flows out of the region power loads should ease somewhat in southern california and that easing will bring some decline in the topock premium pressure on rocky mountains and san juan prices should persist until the start of the heating season in late october see table ceras outlook by region follows rockies pipeline capacity out of the rockies is running nearly full to every export market except the san juan basin emerging pipeline bottlenecks should keep differentials wide during september with an average differential of per mmbtu san juan in the san juan increased imports from the rocky mountains and high utilization rates on capacity into california are pressuring prices cera expects differentials to average per mmbtu for the month of september san juan differentials will narrow more substantially when rocky mountain pipeline bottlenecks are relieved by increases in heating demand during the fourth quarter permian and midcontinent strong power loads in texas have supported permian basin prices during july and august persistent power demand is expected to keep differentials around per mmbtu for september midcontinent prices should average just under permian prices chicago steady storage injection loads are

articles ::::::>>>>>> article on gas marketers top gas gorillas note the discussion on market share halfway through the articletop gas gorillas show strong volume growththe year was a banner year for the top players in gas marketing with huge increases in gas prices enormous volatility continuing growth in sales volumes and major potential for profits physical gas sales volumes for the top marketers in ngis ranking grew to nearly bcfd and profits among the larger players came in very strong with companies such as williams reporting profit increases in their energy merchant segments however for many of the smaller players it was a tough year the big news here is probably the price pressure the marketers have had to withstand said ben schlesinger president of marylandbased consulting firm schlesinger and associates which tracks energy marketing these people have price exposure on both sides of their business the buy side and sell side theyve actively sought to hedge these risks but theres no question that there have been some real stresses in their businesses as a result of quadrupling gas prices in significant shuffling has begun to take place and will continue not just among the leadership but among the whole roster of marketing companies predicted schlesinger for the first time im not sure all will make it because of the price volatility and the stresses that it creates on their balance sheets and their ability to meet the different needs of their customers if you are on the wrong side of a transaction these days in california you are going to suffer significantly its not much different at the henry hub either he noted the harsh reality is that only the strong will survive ronald j barone of ubs warburg believes the california energy crisis and fears of lack of gas supply and capacity are driving customers to the strongest marketers i think that over the long term it will be a positive for the bigger players such as enron customers want to go with somebody who is big has facilities somebody who is going to guarantee it somebody who can do risk management for them enron is the pound gorilla here enron has been the pound gorilla in gas marketing for years but there were always plenty of pound gorillas around last year however enron found a way to trade natural gas over the internet and at last glance was well over pounds more than double the size of its next closest rival gorilla duke energy enron sold bcfd of gas last year compared to only bcfd the year prior and compared to the bcfd sold by duke energy which came in second place in ngis ranking of gas marketers by physical sales volume enron catapulted itself to the next level with the help of its handy new tool enrononline its webbased proprietary energy and commodity trading system that now handles about mainly natural gas transactions each day in enron completed its first full year of deploying enrononline which quickly became the worlds largest webbased ecommerce site during the year enron executed transactions online with customers totaling billion of gross value the tremendous success of enrononline led many observers to wonder whether market concentration was beginning to take place in the industry when you look at enrons massive increase in wholesale transactions you have to wonder about that concentration enrons bcfd is pretty large when compared with the bcfd that is actually consumed in north america but you have to factor in multiple trades one marketer trades a given molecule of gas to another marketer and so on according to schlesinger the socalled churning factor is close to three in the past several years when weve been polling marketers we got numbers in that came to about tcf we added up all the physical sales by all the marketing companies we did not have response in our survey some of the midsized and smaller companies didnt respond we reasonably extrapolated that about tcf maybe even tcf of gas was traded each year in north america physical consumption in north america is about tcf so divided by is about using that calculation enron with bcfd of physical gas sales in ends up with a not unreasonable market share when the federal trade commission looks at markets and market share it uses several tools one of which is the herschmanherfindahl index a measure of market concentration its the sum of the squares of the market share of each participant if one company owns the entire of the market thats an hhi of the department of justice has been using as a red flag when it considers approval of mergers and acquisitions according to schlesinger the total gas industry has an hhi of only about way below any suggestion of market concentration its so low that its unbelievable its a highly competitive business even if one competitor has of the market hhi of and the next competitor has and on down it certainly doesnt send up any red flags he said it could be that market concentration in the gas industry has risen a bit in but this information alone would not diminish the fact that the industry is one of the most competitive businesses in the united states however there may be some regional issues we have to think about he added we havent looked at that so i cant comment on whether anyone has undue market power in a particular region or state for example there is a snowball effect going on among the top marketers the leaders keep getting larger volume growth averages at least per year or more several factors should fuel future growth price increases volatility and uncertainty of supplies are driving buyers to the larger marketers according to both schlesinger and barone online trading has become a new springboard for additional growth by allowing greater efficiency and many more trades to take place schlesinger said he believes electronic trading was responsible for a good part the increase in volumes enron attributed much of its growth to the online business according to some observers online trading still has plenty of room to grow altra energy ceo paul bourke believes about of all gas trading now takes place over the internet bourke said altra had natural gas trades on its system in december however barone predicts there eventually will be a slowdown in gas marketing growth in the united states as international energy markets grab the attention of many marketers international should pick up the slack and contribute increasingly to the bottom line he said barone also expects the current market situation and the continued interest in service supply and commodity versatility to continue driving marketing companies together i think size scope and scale are incredibly significant only one of the top major marketers last year resulted from the combination of two separate predecessors axia which grew out of the combination of koch energy and entergy the rest of the group achieved its growth without major acquisitions or mergers thirteen out of the top marketers showed double or tripledigit volume growth with only two companies in the minus column pge had the largest volume deterioration of any of the large marketers with a decline in annual volumes and a decline in quarterly volumes pge went through a significant reorganization last year the move of its national energy group neg to bethesda md from houston had the greatest impact on its trading activity but the company also sold its energy services business and its texas gas transmission assets among other changes it really slowed down our trading and a large number of people stayed behind in houston said company spokesman patrick hurston at the time of the move the company estimated about half or would make the move hurston wouldnt say how many actually made the trip but the company is still actively hiring transcanada which also underwent a massive reorganization last year was the other company in the minus column with a decline in sales volume the remainder of the group experienced large increases in volumes enron at duke with growth sempra with and bp amoco with growth

articles ::::::>>>>>> el paso articles todayngi note the following articles deal with different issuesst marketing relatednd operationsmarketing relatedrd legislativeregulatory relatedel paso explosion takes mmcfd off marketabout bcfd of flow on el pasos south mainline downstream of pecos river nm station ceased after the pipeline exploded early saturday killing people and seriously injuring two others at a nearby campsiteel paso said monday it was able to compensate for about half that volume through a combination of fuel switching by downstream customers maximum storage withdrawals an ofo and other customer cooperation the market reaction was rather predictable as all three california points rose by about cents to lead an overall price surge however utilities in the state did not appear to be experiencing any supply problems socal gas said storage and supplies from other southwest receipt points were adequate to avoid any problems a gas operations official for los angeles dept of water and power also saw no reason for panic from past similar incidents on southwest pipelines he expected that the approximately feetlong section missing from el pasos line could be slapped back into place rather quickly el paso itself had no estimate for when it can restore service in the impacted segment it must get approval rom the federal investigators before beginning repairs or evaluating a restart of the adjacent lines but a large aggregator and a marketer agreed with the ladwp official that it should be a quick mechanical fix once repairs begin the aggregator believed downtime could be as short as a week no customers were cut off as a result of the rupture but some were getting reduced volumes an el paso spokeswoman said northern natural gas was seeing a throughput increase of mmcfd monday while transwestern volumes were up mmcfd as a result of shippers diverting gas away from el pasos south mainline an enron spokeswoman said a producer said she diverted as much of her companys gas as possible from el paso to transwestern people were reluctant to trade permian basin gas monday especially at fixed prices because of doubts about how much would be able to flow several sources said permian numbers rose a little less than cents as part of the general upturn however it was waha prices that saw a bigger increase of nearly cents as a result everything in el pasopermians keystone pool was going back into waha said a marketer putting waha in the mid s at a premium of more than a nickel above henry hub the southern california border at an average of nearly led the rest of mondays market by a large margin before trading began enrononline was offering border swing swaps for the rest of the month at a marketer said with swing swaps priced so high it gave sellers more confidence in what prices they could command in the day market he said either way i wouldnt want to be short right now at the border there were lots of rumors but no facts available on what caused the el paso rupture noted one aggregator but its a good thing it didnt happen until after california had cooled off otherwise i could easily have seen the border basis spread from san juan basin go as high as instead of the approximate gap of egistered monday by daily gpi a knowledgeable source provided his analyis of the blast the structure of the crater made the rupture look like a line integrity problem from the way it blew out the earth can harbor leaking gas for a while until eventually everything all goes up at once people nearby would not have detected anything because gas is odorless in longhaul lines the mercaptan odorant is not added until it gets to the local distribution stage pipeline safety surveyors usually will look for dead vegetation in the vicinity to detect a leak but this was a desert area with very little vegetation it is easily possible for escaping gas to hug the ground for the approximate foot distance to the victims campsite and seek an ignition source there it is a normal tendency for gas leaking into the atmosphere to stay close to the ground and that tendency would have been amplied by the chilliness of the predawn desert the source went on to say i think there will be lot more of this ruptures in the future with many pipes becoming at least years old el paso was unlucky in experiencing one of the early incidents he said because the situation applies to the other lines with old pipe pipelines used to spend a lot more money on maintenance when regulation was tighter and they were still paying for depreciation he said now theyre more purely forprofit companies after having written off their depreciation costs many times over el paso blast kills shuts down south mainlinefederal and company investigators monday swarmed over the scene of the devastating el paso natural gas mainline explosion that erupted near daybreak saturday engulfing a party of weekend campers along the pecos river near carlsbad nm and killing people two other persons were hospitalized in critical condition three officials from the federal office of pipeline safety ops and with the national transportation safety board ntsb have been at the site of the blast since late saturday and two more ops officials were en route monday new mexico gov gary johnson who flew to the area on sunday said he wanted to know how many other potential pipeline dangers there are in the state he called for a thorough investigation about bcfd of capacity on el pasos southern leg initially was lost from the ruptured inch line and two looped lines nearby that were shut in after the accident el paso was making up some of the shortfall by drawing the maximum mmcfd from its washington ranch storage field downstream of the accident increased use of other pipelines allocations and cutbacks by customers and the fact that weather had moderated in california helped ease the supply situation nevertheless spot prices increased by about cents for points in california while the rest of the market spurred by hurricane debby went up about cents there was no estimate as to when the looped lines would be back in service according to el paso spokesperson kim wallace we dont intend to put anything back into service until we know for certain that the remaining pipelines are safe wallace said she did not expect them to be back in service today and could give no time frame on when they would be returned to service it is much too premature at this point to predict when the three disabled el paso westbound lines will return to service said patricia klinger a spokeswoman with the department of transportations research and special programs administration rspa which oversees the ops the one that ruptured is definitely going to be out of service for awhile and another line is badly damaged from the fire as for a third adjacent line that could potentially be reopened but we have to test the integrity of that line and have it examined by metallurgists she told daily gpi everyone will be working of course to try to get this line back in service but the safe operation of the pipeline is of premiere importance the three lines shared the same rightofway were just now able to start looking at exactly what happened and how to get that one line back in service klinger said our metallurgist is on his way right now i know hes going to meet with the ntsb when theyre examining the foot section of pipe thats out of the ground as a result of the explosion i think the company also wants to decide what types of tests can be done on this line its not piggable the ntsb which has set up a command center in carlsbad nm declined to make any preliminary speculation about the cause of the explosion its much too early for us to even think about the cause of this accident were only dealing with the factsright now were documenting the pipe itself and surveying the land were going to look at the chronology of when the emergency calls came in document damage to vehicles and injuries said ntsb spokesman keith holloway probably at this point were looking at nine months to a year maybe more before the results of the investigation are publicly disclosed holloway noted the rupture occurred at am mdt in the underground line near the pecos river crossing which is about miles south of the carlsbad caverns national park in a spot popular with local campers and fishermen the blast tore a crater in the earth about feet long feet wide and feet deep according to preliminary reports the pipeline was underground at the point of rupture sending two sections of pipe each about feet long flying hundreds of feet the gas then ignited and shot flames from the broken pipe toward sleeping campers the ntsb estimated there was a gap of to feet between broken ends of the pipeline at the site the fire burned for about minutes before el paso workers manually shut off pipeline valves ten members of two families were burned to death in the blast the families who were related by marriage were camping on public land along the river near where the pipeline emerged from the ground to cross the pecos in an aerial crossing alongside a bridge six were pronounced dead at the scene and four others died at texas hospitals saturday night the dead included five children under the age of six including sixmonthold twins two adults were listed in critical condition monday at a hospital in lubbock tx the ruptured pipeline which el paso said was constructed in is one of four that runs along the southern branch of el pasos pipeline system there is an adjacent inch pipeline and another inch pipeline the fourth a inch pipeline was abandoned and is not available for service wallace said el paso and federal officials are particularly interested in the integrity of the second inch pipeline that ran close to the broken line wallace said that none of the companys customers had been cut off of service but they were receiving gas as reduced levels she also said that on aug a patrol inspection either done by air or vehicle was conducted on the pipelines located near the pecos river by el paso officials and no problems were found el paso conducted the last corrosion test in february and no problems were found then either visual inspections are conducted on all of the systems pipelines once a month

said that if the ntsb review finds something that needs to be changed the company will do whatever needs to be done immediately these situations are so rare she said we dont feel that we need to

tough pipe safety billthe explosion on el paso natural gas system which killed people over the weekend may give congress the added boost to pass a tough pipeline safety reauthorization bill when it returns from recess in september capitol hill insiders said monday this just sadly proves why congress needs to act as soon as it returns on sept to pass the pipeline safety improvement act before any more innocent lives are taken said a spokeswoman for sen john mccain raz in june chairman mccains senate commerce committee voted out the pipeline safety improvement bill that would among other things give states inspection and oversight authority over interstate pipelines require interstate pipelines to consult with states about their integrity plans create stiffer penalties for pipeline safety transgressors and offer protection to whistleblowers who report pipeline violations mccain proposed the agressive safety bill following the product pipeline explosion in bellingham wa that killed three in june mccain has always been determined to pass this bill this year but this obviously sadly strengthens that resolve she said he will make a determined effort for this to happen but whether its brought up for a vote on the senate floor will be up to senate leader trent lott rms the mccain spokeswoman said i have no doubts that the senate will push for pipeline safety when it returns said terry boss vice president of environment safety and operations for the interstate natural gas association of america ingaa on the house side a companion to mccains bill has been introduced as well as a number of other pipeline safety measures but most are at the subcommittee level but the issue could pick up steam in the wake of the el paso blast we must examine why this accident occurred and ensure that it must never happen again said rep joe skeen rnm definitely its a tragic situation boss said referring to the explosion near carlsbad nm which reportedly left a crater about feet deep feet wide and feet long five of the fatalities were children who were spending a weekend camping and fishing with their family along the pecos river the political fallout from the disaster was being assessed in washington dc yesterday any kind of incident has political ramificationswere just not sure how this is going to directly impact pending legislation and regulations boss noted

and northwest natural declined to comment if a transaction is consu mmated it would come nearly six months after the collapse of enrons agree ment to sell the utility to sierra pacific resources that

subject monthly briefing a shoulder month without shoulder prices cera alertcera alert sent tue august title monthly briefing a shoulder month without shoulder pricesauthor zenker snyder moritzburkeemail category alertproduct line western energy url httpwwwceracomcfmtrackeprofilecfmum alternate url httpwwwceracomclientcealtcealtabhtmlas western markets continue to struggle through high august demand and prices for both power and natural gas september looms as the start of the fall shoulder season the shoulder season historically has brought the possibility of a break in weather and a demand drop in both power and gas prices from summer levels cera expects this shoulder season to differ from years past however with power and gas markets producing strong yearoveryear prices and little relief from summer levels even with normal september weatherwestwide power loads will decline but will remain similar to those in june a month with high power prices in addition compared with june levels hydroelectric capacity has dropped owing to reduced stream flows leaving more expensive gasfired generation to replace declining hydroelectric output cera expects occasional hot weather and higher gas prices to push onpeak prices in the west to percent over september levelscontinued strong use of gasfired generation in the west as well as low us storage inventories and tight supply demand balances will keep the pressure on gas prices topock prices are expected to average per million british thermal units mmbtu in septemberthese high september gas and power prices are driven by declining hydroelectric output the months of september through november represent the low point for hydroelectric output in the west with rainfall historically boosting output in december approximately average megawatts amw will be available from hydroelectric facilities during the threemonth period this represents a net reduction in capacity of amw when compared with the recent juneaugust summer months and a reduction of amw when compared with september levels higher more variable power demand the southwest and southern california still experience hot weather in september and regional utilities typically consider it possible that a years peak load event will occur in september spiking loads however can quickly retreat with a return to cooler weather thus power loads and power prices are expected to experience a high degree of variability during september high levels of gasfired generation load growth and a declining hydroelectric resource base will require gasfired resources to serve approximately the same level of demand as in june a month with similar average demand and monthly average onpeak power prices in the per megawatthour mwh range depending on the region this strong pull on gasfired plants will push deep into the generation resource base driving prices upward an additional billion cubic feet bcf per day will be required for gasfired generators in the us west compared with september levels strong north american gas prices natural gas prices are expected to retain most of this summers peak levels as north american supplies remain tight a market anxious about winter demand and price levels will also limit a price retreat this fall as a result average september henry hub prices are expected to trade around per mmbtu an active storm season could keep henry hub prices near the mark strong western basis differentials the strong demand for gas to serve gasfired generation and storage concurrently will maintain western basis differentials at high levels especially in the california markets cera expects a topocktohenry hub differential of per mmbtu during september extended operational problems associated with el pasos pipeline rupture would raise that outlookregional power market drivershotterthannormal august weather transmission and generator outages high natural gas prices and declining hydroelectric output all contributed to a rise in power price levels during august southern california average power prices in august have thus far exceeded july levels by an average of per mwh during the onpeak period and by per mwh during the offpeak period midcolumbia power prices bearing the brunt of fireinduced transmission outages experienced a jump from july price levels of per mwh for the onpeak period and per mwh in the offpeak periodoffpeak prices which have averaged above per mwh during the juneaugust period are clearly defined by the production cost of gasfired resources onpeak prices during this same period at over per mwh in all regions in all months have reflected a significant premium at times over the cost of the marginal system generator see table a return to normal weather should drive westwide loads down by amw in september from august levels however load growth and a return to normal weather are expected to push loads up by amw when compared with september levels these greater loads coupled with a reduction in hydroelectric generation of amw from last septembers levels will create supply tightness during september see tables and hydroelectric coal and nuclear generation together will be insufficient to serve westwide demand in september even during much of the offpeak periods requiring gasfired resources to meet a significant portion of the load gas demand for power generation is expected to average bcf per day in september down from over bcf per day in august but up by a dramatic bcf per day compared with levels in september september power prices will be defined by a floor set by the incremental cost of gasfired generation approximately per mwh with prices frequently higher as demand increases as this summer has clearly demonstrated prices rise in a nonlinear fashion as supplies grow very tight hot weatherinduced loads should provide additional examples of this relationship cooler or hotterthannormal weather in september coupled with the inherent high variability of september loads will produce a wide range of price outcomes under normal weather onpeak power prices are expected to fall in the per mwh range depending on location representing a percent premium to yearago september prices see figure the latest revision of the california independent system operators isos imbalance energy market cap down to per mwh is expected to depress market prices during any weather events in september cera expects the iso price cap to limit prices outside of california as wellpacific northwestalthough demand levels in the pacific northwest are expected to retreat in september by at least amw compared with those in the hotterthannormal month of august the loss in available capacity from hydroelectric resources will amount to amw over the same period see table thus the pacific northwest will be in an even more limited position to export power to other regions with transmission interties operating at below rated capacity during this period power prices in the pacific northwest will maintain their tight relationship with those in northern california these price levels will continue to support the operation of the regions limited quantity of gasfired generation midcolumbia onpeak price levels are expected to average per mwh in septemberoffpeak power price levels in the pacific northwest will also receive a boost from the strong markets to the south the expected september level of per mwh represents the opportunity cost of power sales in surrounding marketscaliforniathe fall months initiate a seasonal shift in price differentials that separates the west into markets that lie north of transmission path and those to the south as in years past hydrodepleted northern california should experience demand levels that must be served by generation resources within the region exports from the pacific northwest dwindle and energy from the nuclear and coalrich southwest is constrained from entering northern california by path import limitations this condition which is expected to persist from september through november allows northern california to price at a premium the expected monthly average onpeak northern california price of per mwh incorporates this dynamic notably the california iso is completing a process to remap the zones in california in part to capture locational price differences more effectivelysouthern california like the southwest will typically experience hot weather episodes in september during these high demand periods prices will rise to peak levels as experienced this summer in addition california as a whole should see average loads in september that are amw higher than those of september occasional cooler weather will sharply but temporarily reduce daily prices southern california benefits from the abundant export capacity of the southwest during cooler weather in that region allowing prices to fall well below those in northern california an per mwh differential between the north and south portions of the state is expected with southern california onpeak prices averaging per mwhoffpeak prices of and per mwh for northern and southern california respectively reflect the continued need for gasfired resources to support september offpeak loadsrockies and southwestan extended period of hot weather in july and august has boosted demand in the rockies a region with growing saturation of residential air conditioning limited transmission capacity and a dearth of cheaper exports from surrounding regions have allowed the rockies to price temporarily at a premium to all other regions in the westa return to normal weather in september should restore the previously tight relationship of rockies prices to those in the north rockies prices are expected to fall with loads with a september monthly onpeak price average of per mwh and an offpeak price average of per mwhcera expects southwest prices to be tightly connected to prices in southern california on a monthly average basis the two regions generally experience the same september weather patterns and a strong mw transmission link between the two market centers allows them to balance loads with each other strong gas prices and occasional market tightnessinduced price runups will maintain onpeak prices at the per mwh level in september offpeak prices will like those in southern california be buoyed by the high cost of gasfired generation a price level of per mwh is expected for offpeak pricesregional gas market driversthe summer competition for gas supply between power and storage continues in north america with gas prices reflecting the intensity of that competition even as the summer power peak subsides in september across the united states the need to continue strong storage injections and the threat of storms in the gulf will keep prices high and volatile the storage deficit now stands at approximately bcf and us storage inventories look likely to head into winter at historically low levels this critical storage situation will keep prices high despite overall declines in power loads in september cera expects a henry hub price of per mmbtu during septemberin the west strong power loads and the potential for power peaks persist through september especially in california overall total demand for gas is expected to decline across the west from bcf per day during august to bcf per day during september see table this load will tend to keep intraregional differentials wide throughout the west during the month the recent price disconnects between the supplyrich rocky mountains and san juan basin and demandcharged california will persist october should bring some change in this dynamic as heating loads in the rockies begin to increasein general winter will bring a dramatic shift in regional pricing differentials throughout the west the summer pressure on rocky mountain supplies caused by high utilization rates on most export pipelines will be relieved somewhat by regional heating loads declines in flows into the san juan basin from the rockies will take some downward pressure off prices in the san juan on the other hand healthy california storage inventories should limit price premiums at topock through the heating season the startup of the new alliance pipeline which will draw gas to the midwest will support prices in the pacific northwest and californiacaliforniatopock continues to be the premium pricing point in north america although differentials between southern california and the henry hub subsided somewhat from peak levels near per mmbtu before this weekends pipeline explosion total imports into california reached record levels during july total imports of bcf per day eclipsed the previous high by million cubic feet mmcf per day see table pipeline capacity into the state during the month ran at percent utilization so far in august pipeline capacity utilization is exceeding even that high rate running at percent these high rates of capacity utilization are putting pressure on gas prices in southern california and the pressure should continue during septembertotal demand in california is expected to decline somewhat during september but continued strong power loads and low seasonal hydroelectric generation will provide support total demand in the state should average bcf per day down only slightly from augusts total of bcf per day flows into the state between august and september are not likely to change significantly but price pressure should decline somewhat with demand the topock differential to the henry hub should average approximately per mmbtu for september see table storage inventories in the west are still healthy relative to levels in the rest of the united states but the storage surplus in the region has eroded in california inventories are running lower than last year and the deficit in the state looks likely to widen during september the end of injection season storage inventories will determine the vulnerability of topock differentials to winter price spikespacific northwestmalin prices this summer have shown neither the strong premiums that topock prices have shown nor the wide discounts that supplies in the rocky mountains and san juan basins have shown so far this month prices at malin are averaging a per mmbtu discount to the henry hub pipeline capacity into the region from the rocky mountains is running nearly full flows on pgt out of alberta have averaged nearly bcf per day this month export capacity out of the region on pge gt nw is running close to capacity and pipeline constraints to the south combined with strong california demand are driving the wide malintotopock differentialscontinuing strong demand in the south will likely keep topock prices strong and the wide northsouth differentials within the west will likely hold through september in the pacific northwest demand is expected to climb through september to bcf per day from bcf per day in august this demand level should keep malin differentials from widening from current levels for september cera expects malin prices to average per mmbtu below the henry hub pricesouthwestprices in the san juan basin this summer have been left behind by rising california demand although the westward pull on supplies is strong bottlenecks between california and the san juan have led to disconnects between san juan prices and topock prices pipeline capacity utilization rates on transwestern and the northern leg of el paso reached percent during july with less than mmcf per day of excess pipeline capacity increased flows from the rockies on transcolorado and northwest are contributing to downward pressure on san juan basin supply and in general the san juan has followed rocky mountain prices rather than following prices at topock or the permian basinunlike in the past two summers the bottleneck has not allowed power demand on the west coast to support san juan prices relative to permian prices the differential between san juan and permian has averaged per mmbtu so far this month and per mmbtu since june additional imports from the rockies into the san juan have increased supply by mmcf per day relative to last summer but these higher flows do not fully explain the disconnect without much change in southwestern or rocky mountains local demand the san juan should continue to price at a wide discount during september the san juantohenry hub differential is expected to average per mmbtu as in the rockies differentials should narrow substantially in octoberrocky mountainsdownward pressures on rocky mountain prices intensified over the past month as utilization rates on pipelines out of the region continued to climb record heat and power generation levels have done little to boost gas demand within the region generation is still largely coalbased and the demand impact on gas of the additional load is minimal cera expects the heavy discountcurrent rocky mountaintohenry hub differentials are around per mmbtuto persist through september local area demand is not expected to change during september substantial gain in local demand comes in october with heating loads october demand should average bcf per day up from august and september averages of around bcf per dayalthough the winter heating season will relieve pipeline pressures in the rockies winter differentials are expected to stay in the to per mmbtu range strong storage inventories will limit the connection with broader north american markets this summer next summer pressures on rockies supplies will likely intensify relative to this summer although pipeline expansion projects have been announcedtrailblazer and williams announced expansion plans this summerthe new capacity will not be online to relieve constraints next summer cera expects supplies within the rocky mountains to increase by mmcf per day next yearwestern canadaafter widening to over us per mmbtu the aecohenry differential has begun to narrow somewhat maintenance that has restricted flows has largely been responsible for the jump from per mmbtu in july with current supply able to

c per gigajoule for september even with the startup of the alliance project the contract nonrenewal on transcanada is likely to continue the twotiered pricing dynamics of contracted versus

articles ::::::>>>>>> ngi article on tw hearing after first day transwestern denies withheld capacity to boost negotiated deals a transwestern pipeline executive yesterday dismissed allegations that the pipeline withheld firm transportation capacity bound for california from its recourserate shippers last winter in order to free up more capacity for contracts at substantially higher negotiated rates mary kay miller vice president of rates and certificates acknowledged transwestern may have had discussions and exchanged faxes prior to posting its available capacity with two shippers sempra energy and richardson products ii ltd that subsequently entered into negotiatedrate transactions but she stressed that requests for capacity by sempra energy and richardson were considered moot by the pipeline until after the available operational capacity was posted even if they would have senta fax the day before capacity became available it would have been irrelevant because there was no capacity posted at that time said miller capacity requests that came in prior to jan the day that available capacity was posted for february contracts on transwestern were null and void the only relevant ones were those that transwestern received on or after jan she noted miller spent much of wednesday on the stand being quizzed by lawyers for ferc and producers about transwesterns methods for notifying customers about available capacity the manner in which it chooses winning bids and about its preposting contacts with sempra energy and richardson it was the first day of a ferc hearing exploring charges that transwestern exercised market power in awarding negotiatedrate contracts that led to shippers being charged as much as mmbtu last february far in excess of the pipelines maximum allowed rate of centsmmbtu for firm transportation service to the california border the commission proceeding yesterday focused on four negotiatedrate contracts of sempra energy and richardson for a total mmbtud of service on transwestern during february and march richardson and sempra clearly did not have any deal entitling them to the posted capacity before it was posted miller said in prepared rebuttal testimony the two companies had the right to the capacity only after they submitted their bids after the posting period ended after transwestern determined that no other bids were submitted and after a contract was agreed upon between transwestern richardson or sempra she noted despite claims made by ferc energy industry analyst barry e sullivan to the contrary transwestern did not withhold capacity that otherwise could have been made available under recourse rates in order to make the capacity available under substantially higher negotiated rates miller testified sullivan an analyst in the ferc office of markets tariffs and rates omtr division of litigation contends that transwestern threatened to withhold capacity unless shippers agreed to negotiated rates in fact he believes the preposting discussions between transwestern and shippers were intended to raise doubts about the availability of capacity at the maximum recourse rate so that shippers might be more willing to enter into negotiatedrate contracts above the recourse rate in the hope of securing some of the capacity if and when it became available but miller counters that sullivan offers not support for his claim she noted that even sempra energy and richardson in response to a data request by southern california edison support transwesterns claims both companies replied no when asked whether any employee of transwestern or any transwestern affiliate ever indicated at any time that transwestern would not provide the capacity at the maximum tariff rate the capacity at issue was offered on transwesterns web site at the recourse rate in the exact same manner that all other capacity is offered on transwesterns web site at the recourse rate there was no prohibition restrictions limitation condition or suggestion that a potential shipper could not bid for the capacity at the recourse rate and any potential shipper including richardson or sempra could have submitted a bid for the capacity at the recourse rate sullivan contends that transwesterns motive for allegedly advancing negotiatedrate transactions at the expense of recourserate deals was pure profit under questioning by thomas j burgess of fercs omtr miller conceded that transwestern earned million from sempra energys contract in march million from richardsons march contract and a comparable amount from richardsons february contract she noted the pipeline received a substantially higher amount as a result of sempras february contract but she didnt provide an exact figure fercs sullivan estimated the pipelines profit from the sempra february contract was more than million sullivan said that much of the profits that wound up in transwesterns coffers would have gone to sempra energy and richardson if they have been able to acquire the capacity at recourse rates but miller countered that the commissions negotiatedrate policy does not require a minimum level of profit to shippers or contemplate any hindsight analysis of whether shippers could have gotten a better deal or made more profits furthermore she said the transwestern case shouldnt be used to consider changes to the negotiatedrate policy as sullivan has suggested this case is the wrong forum for such an issue because modifying the negotiatedrate policy should only be done on an industrywide basis so no pipeline or group of pipeline customers is competitively disadvantaged

articles ::::::>>>>>> utilicorp reaquires aquila stock and takes aquila name utilicorp to reacquire and then become aquila utilicorp united announced plans to buy back the of its trading and risk management arm aquila inc that it sold to the public earlier this year and adopt aquila as its corporate name the move is a strategic reversal apparently prompted by the weakening economy and industry changes executives dodged questions as to whether the move was spurred by the financial troubles at the energy industrys largest trading house enron corp on this busy wednesday utilicorp also released its earnings and reported that it has entered into an acquisition agreement with a firstenergy corp subsidiary utilicorp said its board of directors voted to make an exchange offer to acquire all of the outstanding publicly held common shares of its owned aquila inc subsidiary due to the recent significant changes in the merchant energy sector the general economy and the impact of these changes on the capital markets the most significant influence however was the realization that greater shareholder value could be obtained by recombining the financial strength of utilicorp with the growth opportunities that lie ahead for aquila said richard c green jr chairman and ceo of utilicorp with its larger asset base earnings potential and cash flow the combined company will have more efficient access to capital to execute its ambitious plans industrywatchers questioned whether some of the spark for the recombining of the trading operation with the hardasset backed parent could have been prompted by enrons current debacle when asked during the conference call if the enron situation factored in the decision to combine utilicorp and aquila robert green said the decision evolved over the recent few weeks as we evaluated the opportunities in front of aquila and the current conditions in the capital market we effectively came to the conclusion that if we are going to put aquila in a position to execute on these opportunities it is essential that we recombine the businesses and the balance sheets to execute on the opportunities that we see in the marketplace that are precipitated by the decline in the capital markets and the fact that the equity markets are shutdown the merchant strategy behind aquilas rapid growth has been a key driver behind utilicorps achievement of aggressive earnings targets richard green said we decided that utilicorp shareholders would be better served by embracing the aquila energy merchant strategy as the companys core strategy rather than spinning the business off as a separate entity to symbolize that change in thinking we intend to adopt aquila as our corporate name after our exchange offer is completed the company said in its conference call that it expects to complete the reacquisition of aquila by early january richard green also said he will take on a new role effective jan initially as chairman of utilicorp and later of the new company that will be formed from utilicorp united and aquila inc robert k green president and coo of utilicorp will be elevated to president and ceo of the new aquila utilicorp said all public aquila shareholders will be offered shares of utilicorp common stock in a taxfree exchange for each outstanding share of aquila class a common stock based on yesterdays closing price of per share for aquila class a common stock and per share for utilicorp common stock the offer represents a value of per class a share of aquila and a premium to yesterdays closing price of those shares aquila shareholders will have the opportunity to continue to participate in aquilas growth through their ongoing ownership of utilicorp shares and to receive cash dividends as utilicorp shareholders richard green said the offer requires that at least a majority of aquilas publicly held class a shares are tendered after successful completion of the exchange offer utilicorp has committed to complete a shortform merger of aquila with a utilicorp subsidiary in the merger each remaining aquila class a share will be converted subject to the exercise of appraisal rights into the same number of shares of utilicorp common stock as are paid in the exchange offer utilicorp plans to file its offering materials with the securities and exchange commission and commence the exchange offer as soon as possible over the past year i have devoted an increasing amount of time and energy to raising other chief executives awareness of aquilas broad capabilities richard green said we have a unique position in the emerging market that is being created by the convergence of the insurance capital and energy businesses combining our expertise in risk management wholesale energy structured financing generation assets and other related activities we can help clients in countless industries in ways theyve never thought of and that opportunity is largely driving this change in executive roles the company also reported wednesday that it expects to enter into an acquisition agreement with firstenergy corp under which utilicorp and a financial partner will purchase firstenergys wholly owned avon energy partners holdings subsidiary the holding company for midlands electricity plc midlands electricity is the fourthlargest regional electricity company in the united kingdom and serves million network customers utilicorp said the transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of after receipt of regulatory approvals in the companys conference call robert green said the acquisition would likely be strongly accretive in in releasing its earnings utilicorp followed the strong third quarter results from its aquila subsidiary and reported earnings per share for the third quarter were up from last years third quarter after adjusting for the gain from the initial public offering of uecomm ltd in australia the company posted earnings for the quarter of million a decrease from the million mark for the same quarter of utilicorp said energy sales for the quarter were billion up from billion during the third quarter of at aquila we continue to see increasing client demand for our risk management solutions said robert green in addition our recent capacity acquisitions are performing beyond our expectations our network businesses continue to help fuel our core growth in earnings before interest and taxes ebit combining that with the solid results from aquila utilicorp continues to be on track to deliver at least earnings growth this year utilicorp cfo dan streek said during the conference call that the company expects eps to be in the area of the cfo added that this far exceeds the companys growth target for guidance streek said the combined eps for utilicorp and aquila would be around earnings before income taxes ebit for the quarter utilicorp were led by strong contributions from aquila as well as the international business segment aquilas operations increased from million to million net of minority interests of million in the third quarter marking a increase utilicorp attributed some of aquilas growth to the fact that gas and power commodity markets are slowing down forcing aquilas clients to focus more on risk and how they can minimize exposure as a result aquila has seen an increase in its clientfocused businesses additionally aquilas december acquisition of interests in six power plants through its purchase of gpu international have provided strongerthanexpected operating results the company reported that gas trading volumes in the third quarter increased from bcfd during the third quarter to bcfd power volumes increased from million mwh to million mwh ebit from international networks increased to million from million in the third quarter excluding last years gain of million or per share from the initial public offering of uecomm ltd the company said ebit from canada and australia increased primarily due to the full quarter contribution of electric properties in alberta purchased on aug and strong performance in australia related to continued strength in the united energy business and the addition of alintagas which was purchased in october in the united states utilicorps networks had ebit of million in the third quarter of compared to million in the period the company said the contribution from the st

dominance in canadas natural gas market and to boost its production by pancanadian petroleum ltd yesterday agreed to purchase montana power co for million the properties will extend pancanadians existing shallow gas properties in southern alberta into northern montana adding mmcfd and barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids the acquisition will give pancanadian properties in alberta montana colorado oklahoma and wyoming along with three gas pipelines linking alberta and saskatchewan to montana we have a focus on natural gas said ceo david tuer during a conference call yesterday in calgary this is clearly our future it is difficult to put any negative on this acquisition and its likely to stay valuable for the foreseeable future montana powers production is more than natural gas and associated liquids and the acquisition substantially extends pancanadians land and infrastructure allowing it to use its technology and operating strategies in a region that extends along the albertamontana border the montana power assets clearly fit our strengths and allow us to employ our expertise in developing long life reserves of shallow and medium depth natural gas tuer said the potential in these assets is significant and over the next few years we will add substantially to pancanadians daily natural gas production tuer said that the acquisition extends the companys dominance in shallow gas and called montana power a beautiful fit with pancanadians gas strategy land position and technological capability pancanadians newest acquisition adds reserves of bcf and mm barrels of oil and natural gas liquids on a proven and onehalf probable basis said officials production and reserves account for million of the purchase price while the remainder is made up of million for the midstream and marketing assets million for the undeveloped land about acres and million of working capital tuer said the company was paying centsmcfe of proven and onhalf probable reserves the price for daily flowing production based on a ration of gas to boe is mcfe or boe along with the added alberta and montana properties pancanadian also picks up some land in colorados denver basin which now produces about mmcfd other land that is part of the sale is located in the anadarko basin of oklahoma and the green river basin of wyoming three natural gas pipelines that cross from montana into alberta and saskatchewan also are included the pipelines allow direct access to the us markets for southern alberta and saskatchewan gas and serve more than million net acres of developed and

deep cut gas processing and fractionation plant in colorado the fort lupton co plant processes more than mmcfd and barrels of natural gas liquids and condensate in all the total developed and undeveloped land is roughly million net acres or million gross acres said pancanadian montana power fit us like a glove tuer said during the conference call he said the acquisition will help pancanadian to remain best of class for what it does it makes our sandbox that much bigger the acquisition which is expected to close around oct will increase both pancanadians net income and cash flow this year and in subsequent years said tuer the added gas production will immediately increase the companys natural gas as a percentage of total production to based on a ratio of gas to boe about of the natural gas being acquired from montana power now is being sold to montana power utilities for to mmcf until july and because its priced below the open market officials think future earnings will be good as that contract expires theres a lot of potential from the price in this transaction tuer said and whats to become of montana power earlier this year the yearold company headquartered in butte announced it would divest itself of four of its traditional energy businesses by selling its coal production natural gas transmission and distribution independent power production and oil and gas exploration and production businesses it plans to reinvest the proceeds in touch america a fiber optics and telecommunications business which is also a subsidiary of montana power the process to determine the buyer for our oil and gas business was robust and we are delighted with the result said montana power ceo robert p gannon we believe there will be a meshing of business strategies and that cultural synergys exist between the purchased companies and pan canadian he noted that montana power has had a canadian presence for almost years pancanadian purchased the entire oil and gas division which now employs about pancanadian plans to maintain a regional office in butte invest in the acquired properties and grow daily gas production there was no word on whether any jobs would be

monday that he was sure that the riskreward ratio in the planned merger with enron corp made it clearly worth doing the deal because the issues that decimated the former market leader were with its noncore businesses explaining that his team had adequately bracketed the downside as the deal fell together over the past few weeks watson said he could not be positive but noted that the upside was substantial and said he had a good deal of confidencethat well be absolutely fine here dynegy which announced a billion cash stock and debt deal with its downtown houston rival on friday night joined with enron executives including chairman kenneth lay on monday to answer as many questions as they could in about minutes if all goes to plan the two companies would become dynegy inc by the third quarter of the clear leader in natural gas and power marketing in the second quarter enron and dynegy combined sold a total of bcfd of gas which represented of the volumes sold by the top gas marketers in north america bcfd according to a ranking by ngi enron was the top gas marketer with bcfd and dynegy was no with bcfd statistics provided by marylandbased energy performance review epr show that enron and dynegy combined sold million kwh of power in the second quarter that total represented of the power sold by the top largest power marketers million kwh according to epr enron was in fifth place among power marketers with million kwh sold while dynegy was in sixth place with million kwh the blending of the two will not come without challenges but watson stressed he expects to see more opportunities than problems the opportunity appears to have come none too soon for enron greg whalley enrons president and a future member of dynegys executive team confirmed that without some kind of equity investment in the company the once market leader probably could not have sustained its liquidity through the rest of this year we definitely needed to raise some type of equity capital said whalley under normal market conditions we would have had adequate liquidity this was not normal for enron we would not have had liquidity to the end of the year asked about asset sales in anticipation of meeting federal requirements to merge executives acknowledged there would be some but did not elaborate whalley said that from an enron perspective we have not spent a lot of time with dynegy people to agree on a plan chuck watson has to clear what is core to dynegy there are several assets for consideration to sell on the list enron chairman kenneth lay who will not be part of the management team but may hold a place on the dynegy board of directors added that enron already has billion in sales under contract all expected to close by the end of we also have three other significant international assets under contract said lay referring to the among other things the dabhol power plant in india once the merger of dynegy with enron is successfully completed the new dynegy will become the primary market player in all markets but there will be a significant difference in how the company moves forward noted dynegy cfo rob doty enrons financialbacked trading strategy will merge with the strong asset base of dynegys dynegy has protected itself on the downside however the deal includes an out for dynegy if enrons legal liabilities exceed billion asked about the possibility that some of enrons marketing and trading team may desert the company for another company watson stressing that teamwork will be the guiding force going forward said if i were in this industry this is the combination id work for this is an exciting day here its been an exciting couple of weeks creating a platform for something really special in the future enrons whalley said that he believes the company will keep most of its team intact theyre accustomed to being part of a winning deal he said and going forward they will be very pleased with the additional infusion of equity and the stability in the marketplace as of monday morning whalley said that activity looks pretty good and said there had been a positive reception to the merger right now people are pleased with the introduction of new liquidity and really want to go about establishing or reestablishing the energy franchise dynegy president steve bergstrom agreed most traders want to be part of a winning team this is a combination that will be a winning team we have similar issues there as well the a players will stay around to be part of the winning team bergstrom explained that when the merger is complete the new dynegy will become the primary player in all markets he said dynegy has a more assetbacked strategy adding that he has said before that you can only have one market maker and enron clearly was it by combining the two companies there will be a blend of dynegys asset strategy with enrons financial skill set giving the new entity more liquidity marketmaking than dynegy itself has historically done added watson both companies had a successful ratio and nothing is going to change thereim a strong believer in teams and the team concept i dont want to see individuals do well if the company doesnt do well it will be imbedded in the whole company ben schlesinger whose company schlesinger associates analyzes the energy industry said monday that the big problem in the merger is whether these two companies are able to pull togetherto harness whats there he said the two parties are clearly leaders but theoretically they will have to streamline their operations both books are fairly strong he said and once their efficiencies are put together the new company will offer stable returns in the very short term however schlesinger said there will be moves to other traders other analysts also seemed to be throwing support behind the merger ubs warburg reiterated its strong buy rating on dynegy noting that if successfully executed this transaction would yield the most widely recognized respected and downright credible wholesaleretail energy merchant in the world however ubs warned that dynegy still faces a daunting task in merging the operations and employees we are not naive in underestimating the enormous challenge at hand in the nearterm enron must remain highly liquid investment grade and its employees must remain focused on keeping its core wholesaleretail franchises up and running merrill lynchs donato eassey reiterated the buy on dynegy and moving to no opinion on enron he said dynegy has all the necessary skill sets and as importantly the financial stability resources and investor confidence and experience to get the job doneenrons unparalleled online trading business should translate to significant prospects for the new dynegy curt launer an analyst with credit suisse first boston added that despite the size of the new company we do not expect major divestitures or closing issues because of the lack of asset concentration and the inherent competitiveness of the natural gas and power marketing business he noted too that with the combination we have modeled a merchant unit that does less business because of cross trading between them and some expectation of a loss of market share still launer said dynegy would become a formidable competitor benefiting from a market share in excess of of us natural gas and power trading markets as expected with most major merger announcements moodys investors service placed the ratings of dynegy and its subsidiaries under review for possible downgrade noting that notwithstanding the franchise benefits of the proposed merger the financial and business risks associated with the transaction could negatively impact dynegys credit fundamentals the review affects about billion of dynegy securities including its subsidiaries illinova corp and illinois power co in its rating review moodys said it will assess dynegys plans to meet the liquidity needs of the combined entity and to deal with the uncertainty surrounding enrons offbalance sheet transactions and contingent risksand examine the ultimate structure of the transaction and its impact on dynegys financial leverage and on managements targeted debt levels the ratings service also plans to consider the governance framework within which the combined trading activities will operate ratings under review are dynegys prime rating for commercial paper dynegy holdings baa senior unsecured debt rating and its prime rating for commercial paper illinova corps baa senior unsecured debt rating and illinois power cos baa senior secured and baa senior unsecured debt ratings and its prime rating for commercial paper fitch revised its rating watch on enrons outstanding securities to evolving from negative where they were placed in late october the rating watch evolving means the ratings may be raised lowered or maintained fitch also placed a rating watch negative on dynegy and dynegy holdings longterm credit ratings which also means they could be lowered or affirmed the outstanding f rated commercial paper programs for dynegy and dynegy holdings were not affected

articles ::::::>>>>>> so cal edison claims withholding of pipeline capacity edison charges gas market manipulationsouthern california edison filed a motion late last week with the california public utility commission seeking emergency relief from high spot gas prices on which its power purchase rates are based the company told the cpuc that southern california border topock az prices in the last month have risen by mmbtu possibly because of market manipulation in particular the withholding off of the market of pipeline transportation capacity between the supply basins and the california border there is substantial and compelling evidence that the basis differential has been and continues to be grossly distorted by market power abuse collusion and affiliate self dealing of outofstate gas suppliers and merchants edison told the cpuc the company noted the cpuc already has filed a section complaint with ferc regarding this issue and is seeking a recision of certain allegedly collusive contracts which it contends have permitted outofstate natural gas suppliers and their affiliates to drive up artificially california border gas prices by wrongfully withholding capacity it notes the complaint conservatively estimates that the anticompetitive manipulation of the basis differential has already damaged california gas and electricity users by million annually since the beginning of edison seeks an expedited order authorizing it to use the posted gas price of mmbtu which was applied to sces august avoided cost posting to calculate its payment obligations to qualified power producers for the month of october and every month going forward it estimated september bidweek border prices would average mmbtu if such prices were used in edisons september avoided costs posting its transition formula payments to certain independent power producers will be million more than the month prior the company told the cpuc no mechanism exists to recapture the increase in such payments if it is later determined by this commission or in another forum that the topock border indices are unreliable at this time

articles ::::::>>>>>> alliance update note alliance announced an october official inservice date for tariff services however they will be selling test gas in ramp up period right now these first deliveries are going into the anr system because it is the only interconnect that is readyalliance delayed but deliveries begin ramping upafter months of speculation in the industry alliance pipeline confirmed yesterday full commercial service will be delayed nearly a month until oct when construction of the system was scheduled nearly three years ago oct was the target date for commercial service however the delay doesnt mean the market wont be getting any canadian gas out of alliance until the end of october the pipeline opened one of its chicago delivery valves last thursday and started selling mmcfd of gas into the market it intends to increase its sales each week eventually reaching its full bcfd load prior to switching to commercial service on oct said spokesman jack crawford we got commission approval to actually sell our test gas right now i think we are dealing with three or four different marketers our initial deliveries right now are into the anr system thats because its basically the only connection that is ready but over the next few weeks we expect they will all be ready to go and we will test them all id be surprised if it ends up being regular volume increases of mmcfd each week but thats kind of the game plan said crawford on oct it will be alliance selling bcfd of test gas and on oct it will be shippers nominating at one end and delivering at the other the market may not see much of a difference we obviously dont want to start charging our shippers until we have the confidence that all the systems have been checked out the pipeline system is designed to deliver gas from producing regions of northeastern british columbia and northwestern alberta to the chicago area where the line interconnects with the north american pipeline grid currently more than of the total pipeline system has been installed including mainline compressor stations receipt points in british columbia and alberta and delivery points in illinois commissioning activities commenced in march including the flowing of gas into the completed sections of line to purge air from the pipe at present approximately of alliance has been purged of air this includes all the mainline portion of the system miles from near gordondale alberta to the delivery section near joliet illinois and of mile laterals receipt portion of the system additionally receipt point meter stations have been commissioned final commissioning activities are also being completed at mainline compressor stations to date bcf of gas is in the commissioned mainline and lateral portions of the system with the ultimate line pack targeted at bcf crawford said there were a variety of factors that contributed to the delayed startup the rain in saskatchewan delayed us a bit back in july but we managed to catch up on the construction there in august but it then meant that some of our commissioning didnt get going until a little bit later farther west in alberta and bc in fact weve had a couple of rain problems in particular we have one relatively small but fairly long lateral that we havent even been able to get on the right of way yet and thats because of rain up in bc weve been having trouble with a directional drill of a creek on one of our laterals up there he said were likely to get approval to opencut that creek but that will take us probably the better part of a month on the downstream end we had hoped to get more of our downstream connections right now we are testing one but some of the others arent quite ready yet were ready but they are not then of course there is a fairly complex interaction between the pipeline and the aux sable liquids plant we havent had a chance to work on that yet so when you look at all of those things the question was when could we establish a date when all this stuff would be done and we would be operational we spent a fair amount of time with our shippers and they mentioned one other pipeline that was being delayed one day at a time drove them to distraction we agreed we would pick one of three dates all mondays oct oct or oct and we just had to pick one that we felt confident in besides the timing of service there has been another important question on the minds of many market observers will the gas alliance ships come oct be incremental gas or gas that would have been flowing through transcanada i dont think its going to be purely either way said crawford lots of guys are targeting for nov to bring their new gas on to start the gas year so it all depends on how much shows up its not a big secret that weve had some wet weather and some of the drilling and completion work hasnt gotten done thats likely to have some affect on it as well thats a delay though how long are people going to pay for gas boy people are going to have a lot of money for drilling and projects

a highbut justifiedlevel of anxie ty regarding winter supplies is driving the gas market as things stand the market is headed into the winter exposed to a supply shortfall late in the winter even under normal weather conditions this prospect has placed a floor on the ga s price at the price of residual fuel oil itself priced in the mid to upper s range gas prices moving into this range would begin to attract demand back into the market diverting supplies from storage and increasing supply concerns again to the upside there is little demand response to price until industrial demand lessens or the price of distillate oil as of this writing near per million british thermal units mmbtu is breached however distillate markets themselves are extremely tight and prices for that fuel would likely follo w gas prices up within this range prices are defined mainly by supply anxiety the markets judgment of the likelihood of a supply shortfall which would b e characterized by extreme pricing and volatility and a difficult process of supply allocation by price by now exposure to extreme price volatility this winter is certain althou gh cera expects storage injections to increase by approximately billion cu bic feet bcf per day from august to september this increase would still leav e inventories at record lows for this month and next even this increase in injections will not occur if a tropical storm forces evacuation of offshore platforms or if hot weather returns for october heating load enters the picture with us supplies running clos e to yearearlier levels and imports slightly higher demand priced out of the market will remain the key reason that storage injections increase at all from las t years low level as a result although prices may close the month of september in the upper s per mmbtu at the high end of the competitive range with resid any threat of interruption in supplies will quickly bounce prices upward during the remainder of september or in october as the heating season begins therefore cera expects the reality of supply vulnerability for the winter to result in the first ever monthly average price of at the henry hub s ee table and the first of potentially many months at or above that price gas storagenew record lows cera estimates that storage inventories in the united states crossed into record low territory as of the end of august when inventories of bcf fell below the previous record low of bcf see table more records will likely be broken in the coming months and by widening margins injections for september are expected to average bcf per day an increase of bcf p er day from the august level but below last years pace of bcf per day ceras september estimate could be exceeded under mild weather condition s with no tropical activity hitting the gulf of mexico but injections would likely fall below the bcf per day rate should storm activity force evacuation of platforms this rate would leave us inventories at bcf at months end a record low by bcf for october cera expects a slight increase in the injection rate from last year injections of bcf per day on average this year would be enabled by dema nd priced out of the market and by a lack of unusually cool weather or tropica l storm activity october injections have varied historically from bcf pe r day to bcf per day even if injections reached toward the upp

inventory level of bcf und er normal winter weather bcf below the previous record low of bcf regional marketswaiting for winter the pipeline explosion on el paso during late august intensified the subregional pressures already at play in western gas markets cuts in pipeline flows limited access into california on the only pipeline route into the state with any excess capacity the lack of supply pressured prices within the supply basins and forced strong storage withdrawals in the california market although summer power loads in california will ease and much of the el paso capacity has be en restored the race to improve storage positions before the onset of winter heating load will keep intense pressure on topock prices differentials in the rest of the west will strengthen as local heating loads begin to absorb enough supply t o ease pipeline bottlenecks see table differentials in the east which have traded in a narrow range this summer will likely reach slightly higher levels with the start of the heating season in october however exposure to pricing disconnects will remain low until later this year ceras outlook by region follows rockies pipeline bottlenecks out of the rocky mountains this summer should begin to ease as heating loads climb during october cera expects that as local demand limits pressure on pipeline capacity differentials will narrow october differentials should average per mmbtu san juan the resumption of flows on el pasos southern system combined with production outages has relieved some of the access constraints on san juan supply seasonal declines in rockies to southwest flows and the beginning of the heating season should narrow october differentials to per mmbtu permian and midcontinent the continuing pull on supplies from the west will support permian prices and the midwestern pull on supplies will support midcontinent prices cera expects a differential to the henry hub of per mmbtu for midcontinent supplies and per mmbtu for permian supplies chicago the delay in the inservice date for alliance from october to october will take some gas out of the chicago market next month this delay combined with the need to build midwest storage inventories should sustain the recent increase in differentials from the range to above per mmbtu cera expects october differentials at the chicago citygate to average northeast markets gas prices near have increased the fuel cost of delivery from the gulf coast into the northeast raising the floor level for differentials to near per mmbtu the beginning of the heating season

articles ::::::>>>>>> synopsis article notes on fercs conference on competitive natural gas markets olympian status for us gas market just so youll know the natural gas market is a real success story ferc has gotten an enormous amount of things right the market may not be unblemished but there are lots who consider the natural gas market the best market in the world offering genuine price discovery on a daily basis across dozens of products its something everyone should be proud of robert levin of the new york mercantile exchange told a ferc conference yesterday the natural gas market has performed remarkably admirably through a range of market conditions with hundreds if not thousands of market participants using an extraordinary selection of market instruments levin continued adding that the commission should be supporting the growth and increased sophistication of commerce youre at that point now warning against socalled solutions offered by some at the daylong conference to increase liquidity or tie the natural gas market to the electric market levin cautioned liquidity cannot be legislated dont overreact the electric market is poorly regulated remedies from the natural gas market should be transferred to the electric market rather than allow the gas market to be corrupted by the regulatory mistakes of the electric market rather than worry over regulating an hourly market for natural gas change the electric market which levin believes has developed its overemphasis on the hourly market because of the artificial tilt toward the spot market but while levin warned against too much market meddling others among the more than representatives of the industry and its customers testifying at fercs conference on competitive natural gas markets argued for a variety of initiatives to increase market liquidity by changing the rules for pipeline transportation eliminating the shippermusthavetitle rule promoting expansion of the existing pipeline infrastructure especially in the northeast doing away with straightfixvariable sfv rate design review of firmtowellhead rates in the production region and the allocation of transportation costs between the upstream and downstream were among the chief proposals proffered by mostly pipeline customers however greater gas market liquidity shouldnt be confused with increased competition in pipeline transportation municipals and producers told ferc staff during a postorder technical conference wednesday were concerned the commission may be equating market liquidity with competition in pipeline transportation the two are not the same said arthur corbin on behalf of the american public gas association apga which represents municipal gas distributors even with greater and greater market liquidity monopoly power exists in the pipeline transportation segment captive shippers will always require a regulated transportation service from any hub to their citygate he said much the same holds true for ldcs noted bruce henning director of energy practices for energy and environmental analysis inc eea who represented the american gas association aga at the commission staff conference he agreed market liquidity has improved immeasurably but he added theres not a liquid market center at every pipeline receipt or delivery point location nor is there likely to be market centers in all of these locations in the near future consequently henning said ferc will need to continue to protect producers from market power that accompanies limited access to pipelines the daylong conference held yesterday in washington dc was the first of several that ferc staff plans to hold to explore the impact of the commissions transportation policies on the development of gas markets christopher a helms president and coo of panhandle pipeline companies urged ferc not to enact policy changes that would place commodity market liquidity as the ultimate goal at the expense of the transportation market helms said he advocated policies encouraging pipeline expansions and construction of optimal amounts of additional capacity to meet the needs of the market the single most important characteristic for liquidity in the natural gas commodity markets is the availability of adequate transportation capacity charles daverio vice president of keyspan corp echoed that sentiment saying ferc could increase liquidity in the new york city market and elsewhere in the northeast by promoting construction of new pipeline capacity to ensure adequate supplies for the region yearround this would reduce energy costs and enhance reliability he noted panhandles helms also cautioned against policy changes that would force the development of new market centers and hubs market centers should be allowed to develop at their own pace and at locations where the market sees fit he said eeas henning estimated more than liquid and transparent market centers exist today which permit industry participants to buy and sell gas daily under extremely competitive conditions he said hes confident more will be added because of the options that they provide to gas customers as another way to enhance liquidity keyspans daverio as well as others supported eliminating the shippermusthavetitle rule which requires the customer to retain title to the gas while its being shipped doing away with the rule would pave the way for the development of new pipeline products and services such as operational balancing and virtual storage he told the ferc staff but dena wiggins an attorney with the dc law firm of sutherland asbill brennan llp which represents the process gas consumers group industrial gas customers said her group was very concerned about efforts to repeal the rule i havent heard anything yet today that satisfies the concerns that we might have she noted the commission already has granted exceptions to the shippermusthavetitle rule in certain cases and should continue with this policy where necessary moreover wiggins said industrial customers were increasingly worried about the mounting market power of unregulated companies especially gas marketers at the conference she also expressed her groups dismay with the pipeline compliance filings with order particularly on the penalty issue rather than an improved penalty structure pipelines are proposing higher penalties wiggins said we continue to be shocked at the absolute wholesale departures from bps jeff holligan also waded into the fight against all the new services outlined by pipelines in their order filings which he said were nothing more than penalties disguised as balancing services that customers cant refuse he urged the commission to check with a pipelines customers noting one proposed new service is opposed by of the pipelines nonaffiliated customers some of the proposed services holligan said add up to nothing more than degradation of existing longterm firm service holligan representing the largest producer in the us and canada joined other market participants in urging adoption of standardized allocation sales standardized penalty levels and the requirement that all pipelines implement a uniform title transfer tracking process in short standardizing pipeline services certainly on an individual pipeline and also to a large extent between and across pipelines is imperative if markets are to be highly liquidindividually negotiated services where every service is a different service or the adoption of a socalled dual track market are the antithesis of a highly liquid efficient and competitive gas market standardization of operational terms of pipeline service is necessary to facilitate trading through ecommerce the commission should be striving

articles ::::::>>>>>> article on conference governors natural gas summit responding to the growing energy crisis note ken lays comments at the governors natural gas summit responding to the growing energy crisis are quoted in this articleindustry fears consumer backlash because of high prices the natural gas industry should be prepared to face customer revolts and attempts at price caps similar to those witnessed this summer in san diego if its a cold winter and prices continue to hit new highs that was the warning from government and industry representatives at the crisis conference held by the interstate oil gas compact commission iogcc yesterday representatives of producing states and industry speakers were unanimous in opposing government intervention to restrain prices but no one had a ready remedy for consumer reaction if they are hit with a double whammy of greater energy use at higher prices this winter one speaker offered a bright spot the industry might emerge relatively unscathed if the winter is moderate but then he added its not just residential heating bills but electric bills as well that will be impacted by higher natural gas prices others pointed out that demand and higher prices could spur lawmakers to open more areas to drilling and encourage new long lines industrial customers have been dealing with high prices for some time but higher bills for residential and small commercial customers are just starting to hit the radar screen peggy claytor purchasing manager for steelmaker the timken co told the group of more than from the us canada and mexico meeting in columbus oh we may see protests or proposals or calls for price caps this winter she said she is opposed to caps because they fail to solve the underlying problems and she blamed the dysfunctional electricity grid in part for aggravating the runup in natural gas prices asked whether he expected to see a public outcry from residentials this winter stephen l baum chairman of sempra energy whose san diego gas electric subsidiary has borne the brunt of the california debacle and whose prices were capped had a one word answer absolutely enron chairman ken lay agreed if we have a combination of a cold winter with high prices it could send bills up quite substantially certainly there could be some reaction lay said he expected prices to be high for the short to medium term coming down over next two to three years as long as regulators leave it alone this market will come back into balance lay pointed out that even if prices to consumers hit mcf this winter it would be just equal to the price level adjusted for inflation in even at todays prices energy is the best buy there is robert allison jr chairman of anadarko petroleum told the group pointing out how consumer prices for other basics such as houses and cars have increased over the past years the problem with energy prices is they have stayed low for so long if the government wants to take action it should open more public lands to drilling allison said estimating there are tcf of reserves or a year supply that are off limits in the lower states only portions of the gulf of mexico and alaska are effectively open for drilling its up to congress to provide greater access allison said others including alaska gov tony knowles said government should encourage the building of additional pipeline capacity particularly a new pipeline from alaska leading off the governors natural gas summit responding to the growing energy crisis daniel yergin chairman of cambridge energy research associates called the current situation a shock not a crisis a lack of reserves would be a crisis but there are plenty of reserves its simply that demand has accelerated and bumped up against the iron law of lead times he said the industry would have to invest more than billion over the next ten years nearly double the level of the s to keep up with new markets yergin called for the us to coordinate supply development policy with mexico and canada this is not just a us issue and there will not be just us solutions there must be a continentwide response in the meantime the industry should attempt to cushion the shortterm shock through consumer education conservation and low income assistance programs

really mean when they talk about the oil price as part of the study we analyze each of the five contracts that make up the brent market and consider their longterm future given the steady decline of wet barrels including how other price markers might evolve outline how oil companies have more discretion to raise revenues for a given volume of production than is generally appreciated examine each of the three components that make up oil prices absolute price level time and grade differentials to show where revenue is being lost and what can be done to add it back again assess the management

american gas team email category alert product line north american gas url httpwwwceracomcfmtrackeprofilecfmudmd alternative url httpwwwceracomclientnagaltnagaltabhtml the nervousness driving the gas market that had settled just below the surface during the relative calm of late september and early october reemerged in force la st week from midseptember through early october it appeared that a lucky combinati on of mild weather storage injections above billion cubic feet bcf per day and a lack of storms in producing areas of the gulf of mexico had calmed the market somewhat henry hub prices settled near in the cash market less than above residual fuel oil last week however tragedy in the middle east and a slightly lowerthanexpected storage injection report were sufficient to drive novem ber henry hub prices up by more than in two days to above mild weather may still soften prices from current levels but cera does not expect the relative calm of late september and early october to return to the gas market turmoil in the oil market has raised the floor for gas prices as nearly bcf per day of potential gas demand now burning residual fuel oil would quickly return to the gas market should prices decline relative to oil also weather must remain mil d through october or else us working storage inventories may not reach even trillion cubic feet tcf by the end of the month the headroom for price is much greater as distillate oil the next substitute for gas should gas prices rise is itse lf in short supply shutdowns of industrial facilities represent an important increment of demand resistance as gas prices rise and neither switching to distillate n or shutting down production comes easily or cheaply time is running out before the heating season begins and the market remain s justifiably on edge upward volatility remains much more likely than any significant settling in price as a result cera expects natural gas prices to be sustained in the mids averaging

historically from bcf to approximately bcf per day in the united states and this year cera expects them to averag e bcf per day a moderate level for the month see table the reporting of injections of bcf during the week ending october precipitated a increase in futures prices but this rate is actually above average for the first full week of october with the beginning of consistent heating load late this month cera expects a slowing of injections resulting in an endofoctober inventory of bcfmore tha n bcf below the previous record low for the end of october cera expects that many storage holdershaving begun the winter with record low inventorieswill preserve inventories to the extent possible during novemb er however normal weather this year would drive a substantial rebound in heating load from last years level and would require added storage withdrawals whic h cera estimates will average bcf per day this year withdrawals at that pace or even substantially slower as occurred during and will keep inventories on a trajectory to hit record lows by the end of march low storage inventories will remain a major source of price support requiring that demand continue to b

rockies earlyseason cold has narrowed rockies to henry hub differentials so far this month ample supplies within the rockies will mean volatile pricing relationships through the end of october and early november depending on heating load but in general strong regional demand will keep differentials well below the per mmbtu summer level cera expects a per mmbtu differential to the henry hub during november san juan the increase in local heating demand in the rockies will continue to ease pressure on san juan prices by limiting flows south out of the rockies san juan differentials should follow the same relationships as rockies prices with general narrowing but continued volatility through november cera expects an average san juan differential of per mmbtu for november permian and midcontinent tight relationships between the permian basin and midcontinent and the henry hub should continue through november with some slight widening in the midcontinent basis differential expected when alliance flows commence cera expects differentials of per mmbtu and per mmbtu respectively chicago the beginning of service via the alliance pipeline during november is the focus of most attention in the chicago citygate market however the demand rebound that would result from normal november weather this year would offset most of the added supplies as a result chicago differentials will average in the per mmbtu range even when alliance flows commence although delay of the vector pipeline will keep much of the new gas in the midwest cera expects average november chicago

articles ::::::>>>>>> duke stands by their man note see the last paragraph on power plant plans lornaduke stands by california marketin the midst of much uncertainty surrounding californias power situation duke energy north america monday reiterated its commitment to the states struggling wholesale electricity market announcing new bilateral power deals with pacific gas and electric co and progress with redevelopment plans at three coastal power plant sites it is operating duke is committed to continue playing a major role to help california address its electricity shortfall and the high prices many felt this summer said bill hall dukes vice president for the western region in north america noting that brownfield projects in california have turned out to be more difficult than new plants to site based on dukes experience over the last three years in response to questions hall acknowledged that duke is constantly reassessing its position in california and a return by the state energy officials to a costbased regulated market would cause him a lot of concern but he is confident at this point that for the longterm market solutions will be applied he said in his meetings with state political and regulatory leaders he is convinced they know the state cant turn back to a traditional commandandcontrol regulatory structure and they recognize that multiple solutions are needed including balancing supplydemand for power we believe that new generation coming on line throughout the west in the next few years will lessen the market volatility and markets will begin to react based on supplydemand stability hall said both halls and dukes western trading executive nancy deschane said they are very anxious to see what the federal energy regulatory commission releases wednesday with its initial draft decision on what it will do to address california wholesale electricity prices including whether it intends to extend the california independent system operators calisos authority to impose price caps hall said duke has signed a series of substantial longterm wholesale electricity contracts with pges utility that will help stabilize the price volatility for the distributors retail customers he would not disclose the terms of the deal including the volumes and duration but said the supplies are slated to be received in the states northern zone np earlier duke offered california utilities fiveyear deals at mwh dukes salt lake citybased trading arm is doing the deal rather than its californiabased generation plants meaning the power could come from sources inside or outside of the state hall said duke has begun work with local city officials in the san diego suburb of chula vista to accelerate the current schedule for replacing the south bay power plant which duke leases with an option to buy we hope within the next year well be able to announce what we can do to expedite the replacement of this facility he said following approvals from the state and a local water permit last week duke will begin its million modernization of moss landing power plant along the north central coast within the next to days hall said the upgrade will add mw to the sites current mw capacity and will require a increase in the plants natural gas requirements which pges gas utility assures can be handled by the existing pipeline infrastructure weve had discussions with pge and were obviously concerned that we have sufficient infrastructure to transport gas that we purchase into the system hall said were confident that their infrastructure can support moss although he added that statewide we certainly have concerns about the gas infrastructure and duke is working with state officials to assure there are adequate gas supplies we had some problems this summer in southern california and san diego gas and electric recently announced it is going to begin an intense look at what needs to be done to upgrade its gas pipeline infrastructure to support the new generation plants coming on board salt lake citybased deschane said duke has a balanced portfolio of supply and storage contracts noting that she thinks her company has a very strong physical position in the west for gas and the trading unit will be working over the next couple of years to assure that the gas position is sustained and continues to grow down the central coast about miles at morro bay duke has resubmitted revised plans for totally replacing the sera power plant in a renovation that will build a new million mw plant with prompt state approvals hall said duke could bring the new plant online by the summer of and demolish the existing mw plant by adding that pge cannot deliver additional gas supplies so the added output is a product of the anticipated improved efficiency of the new plant

articles ::::::>>>>>> lays comments to ferc on power market note the ferc meeting is today see the link below that can be checked for updatesenrons lay urges bold solutions to power market woesas the federal energy regulatory commission prepared to weigh in this morning with the federal governments answer to californias bedeviled power market free market advocates issued last minute warnings against taking the price cap route espoused by the caliso fercs meeting is scheduled to start at am est check httpintelligencepresscom this morning for updates in a letter fired off to ferc chairman james j hoecker yesterday enron ceo kenneth lay urged the commission to find a fix for the underlying structural problems in the power market rather than follow the steps of policy makers who have placed price cap band aids over hemorrhaging wounds lay told hoecker the power market is halfway across a busy street in its transition from monopoly to competition it cant stand where it is he said ferc has to make a choice between falling into the same trap of political expediency as californias iso leaving the nations electric system in the lurch from one crisis to the next or it can take a big step toward fundamental structural reform at the same time the electric power supply association epsa called on ferc to issue an emergency cease and desist order prohibiting the caliso from unilaterally implementing any changes to its current mwh price cap for wholesale electricity purchases in a motion filed monday the marketer group specifically asked the commission to bar the caliso board of directors from putting into effect its decision to impose a fiendishly complex loaddifferentiated price cap of or less during the offpeak season effective nov the plan was designed by the states main utility consumer group see daily gpi oct in addition the epsa urged ferc to state explicitly that the caliso does not have the authority to impose or extend price or bid caps unless expressly authorized to do so by the commission the calisos current authority to set price caps expires on nov lay said the calisos complicated new formula caps prices below the cost of gasfired generation making obvious errors such as failing to take into account gas transportation costs between the henry hub and power plants in california in doing so the bid cap makes it more economic for generators to sell their gas supply rather than use it to make electricity in california the new formula also forces the iso into the market to buy power on an ad hoc basis to keep the lights on when the capped market fails to attract sufficient supplies which it inevitably will do lay said in addition the capped formula invites generators to shut in production export power out of state and deploy their turbines in other states or countries he noted that the isos chairman voted against the measure while all of the states utilities voted for it presumably knowing full well that it simply will not work california is just the latest failure of partial or compromised open access said lay its time for the commission to reject this approach the power industry the nations most essential industry is mired in the transition from regulated monopoly to open access and customer choice every step forward has been compromised out of concern for alienating one vested interest or another as a result utilities are free to slow the interconnection of new generation withhold equal access to the transmission system favor their own sales over those of competitors miscalculated available transmission capacity and exercise control over supposedly independent system operators and reliability organizations lay predicted that installing price caps for political expediency would plunge markets into greater uncertainty and discourage new supplies and conservation methods ferc has to complete the work that it started said lay it has to ensure that all parties have equal and fair access to transmission by ending the special priority for utility uses of the system second ferc must require transmission owners to separate operation of the monopoly transmission assets from their other businesses third ferc must take politics out of transmission system operations by revising governance structures to ensure independence finally ferc must end its reliance on shortsighted price caps by putting in place the necessary reforms to allow these markets to operate efficiently to encourage conservation and attract new supplies epsa said the caliso board acted in obvious disregard for the commissions orderly processes it cannot be permitted to make the commissions decisions for it or to alter so radically market rules thereby injecting more uncertainty and confusion in the market and

articles ::::::>>>>>> raymond james gas price forecast for note raymond james and associates is predicting gas prices to average in consensus first call estimates are now averaging for read on to hear what the brokerage houses are predicting lornaraymond james sends chills up gas buyers spinesraymond james and associates gave gas buyers a halloween shriek yesterday that could be producing chills all the way through next april perhaps even all of next year the firm released a chilly forecast of double digit gas prices this winter and said it expects prices to average mmbtu in regardless of a potentially warm winter it is highly likely that the united states will experience regional shortfalls in gas supply raymond james said in its latest energy report in other words gas storage should test alltime low levels this winter regardless of weather the situation should get worse not better next year if we end the winter at alltime low storage levels and we cannot inject more gas next summer than we did this summer then we should enter next winter with dangerously low levels of natural gas raymond james added we believe that the united states will see gas demand increase by about bcfd or by the end of as new gas fired electric generation plants come on line unfortunately even if every drilling rig is working us gas supply is likely to increase by less than bcfd by the end of this means that gas prices must rise sufficiently to crimp over bcfd of demand out of the gas supplydemand equation by at mcf only about bcfd of demand has been reduced so far that means that gas prices must go higher over the next several years however raymond james bullish predictions are a far cry above the crowd on wall street plenty of other analysts have upped their forecasts recently to hairraising levels the first call consensus for now is up to mmbtu but thats still cents less than the raymond jamess prediction not everyone wants to scare the daylights out of buyers however deutsche bank believes analysts and the futures market participants at nymex are getting bold and in our view maybe too bold with the natural gas rig count approaching it is hard to believe that there will not be a fairly substantial supply response in deutsche bank said in its energy wire on friday analysts at the us energy information administration are expecting dry gas production to rise to tcf bcfd in after being stuck at near tcf bcfd for several years our own estimate for looks for tcf bcfd and we have seen credible forecasts reaching as high as tcf bcfd in general we think the eia is way too conservative and that our own number is more likely to be adjusted higher rather than lower a gain in domestic production of bcfd to bcfd could be doable imports appear likely to be up bcfd if demand rises by that would account for about a bcfd gain all other things equal this implies that storage can refill and suggests that prices are going to come under some downward pressure

to address the top five issues you identified keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedbacknow heres what were going to do based on

decline in the overall market and economy certain enronspecific issues such as california india and recent management turnover a meltdown in the broadband sector which may have been as much as of our stock price at the high lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winters high and concerns over the pace of energy deregulationthese concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution wholesale and retail businesses very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth and future earnings growth as has enron we fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve over the past month we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses we have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make moneywe also want to make sure that employees know what we are

continue to host espeak sessions to answer employee questions greg whalley mark frevert and i will also hold discussions with various groups of employees which will be taped and made available to

corporate ::::::>>>>>> fw another mentionthen at an afternoon meeting of employees in the companys core natural gas and electricity trading operation which provides by far the biggest part of enrons profits quite a bit of concern was raised about the news people had been seeing about this changeofcontrol payment mark palmer an enron spokesman said at about pm central time two senior executives who had attended the meeting john lavorato and louise kitchen told mr lay about the reaction of employees ken made a decision shortly thereafter that the best thing to do would be to waive the payment altogether mr palmer said even if dynegys directors later voted to award mr lay a new severance agreement he would turn it down mr palmer added original messagefrom armstrong julie sent wednesday november amto lohman tksubject see about tradersthe wall street journalacopyright c dow jones company incenron corp said its chairman kenneth lay has decided to forgo a severance payment of million that could be triggered by dynegy incs planned acquisition of enron mr lays decision capped a day in which he appears to have changed his mind on the matter at least twice early in the day an enron filing with the securities and exchange commission laid out mr lays severance package by midday enron indicated that mr lay would keep only onethird of the payout which he would take in stock in the combined company and that he intended to donate onethird to a foundation to help displaced enron employees the remaining third would cover incometax liabilitiesbut by the end of the day enron spokesman mark palmer said that mr lay following a meeting of enron energy traders had decided against taking any of the severance pay though mr lay didnt attend the traders meeting senior managers told him that opinions were expressed that he shouldnt receive the payment mr palmer said he decided the cleanest thing to do was to waive the payment the opinions of traders carry particular weight because they produce most of enrons profits questions for mr lay were directed to mr palmer who said he had spoken with mr lay and other company officials during the day the initial disclosure about mr lays hefty severance payment raised new questions about his willingness to sell enron for a share price that was about a third of the market price of a month ago last friday mr lay even said that enron had other options to the dynegy purchase which might have allowed the energy company to remain independent though he declined to elaborate things werent desperate we had alternatives mr lay said the yearold mr lay wont have an executive position at the combined company though he might be a director for the months ended aug mr lay received about million through the exercise of enron options according to disclosure reports compiled by thomson financial last year mr lay was paid million in salary and bonus and more than million in stock awards and other compensation enron the nations largest energy trader saw its stock collapse in recent weeks following a series of disclosures about the companys extensive dealings with partnerships run by some of its own officers those dealings are under investigation by the sec last friday enron agreed to be acquired by the far smaller houstonbased dynegy for stock currently valued at about billion the merger agreement still must be approved by regulators and shareholders of the two companies separately the california public employees retirement system which owns about three million enron and dynegy shares said it would oppose the appointment of any current enron board member to the board of a combined company michael flaherman chair of calpers investment committee said that it appeared that enrons board failed in its responsibility to monitor the activities of enron executives mr palmer the enron spokesman said mr lay had provisions in his employment contract to protect him against a sudden change in control from forward in february when enron stock was trading between and a share and mr lay was being widely lauded for his performance he negotiated a bigger severance package than he had previously last august when chief executive jeffrey skilling quit unexpectedly mr lay assumed mr skillings duties and his contract term was extended by two years to dec under the terms of his contract mr lay is entitled to payment of million for every full calendar year left on his employment contract in the event that his employment terminates within days of a change in control thus mr lay is entitled to three full years of payments or million mr lay who took charge of the thenhouston natural gas co in when it was a regional pipeline company wasnt the only member of his family to benefit from enrons heady rise to a global energy giant sec filings show that in recent years a sister of mr lay sharon lay and a son mark lay received millions of dollars in salary commissions and bonuses related to ms lays travel agency and a paperproducts company connected to the younger mr lay mr palmer said it is a cheap shot to criticize the lay family because the pertinent transactions were reported in several annual proxy statements the contracts were bid out and fairly awarded mr palmer said ms lay said her travel agency of which she is president and halfowner had won its enron business through competitive bidding and by providing the very best service possible mark lay couldnt be reached for comment coming on top of disclosures of enrons dealings with partnerships run by its own executives the relationships between lay family members and the company again raise questions about enrons willingness to keep separate corporate and personal interests former chief financial officer andrew fastow and possibly other enron executives made millions of dollars from these partnerships mark lays dealings with enron date back to according to the available sec filings in may mark lay and certain other individuals who together had been officers directors or shareholders of a company called paper print management corp or ppmc entered into employment agreements with an enron unit enron capital trade resources according to enrons proxy statement the individuals helped set up a clearinghouse for the purchase and sale of finished paper products according to the sec filing mr palmer said this effort formed the rudiments of enrons profitable paper and pulptrading business as part of the deal enron agreed to reimburse ppmc million for certain expenses mark lay and his colleagues also agreed to convey to enron certain intangible property rights from ppmc mark lay also got a threeyear employment contract from enron as a vice president of enron capital trade he got a signing bonus of a minimum monthly salary of a minimum annual bonus of for and an option to purchase enron shares mark lay is no longer with enron and is now attending a seminary said mr palmer since sharon lays firm laywittenberg travel agency in the park inc has provided travel arrangements for employees of enron and its predecessor company for this work the agency received million from through in an interview yesterday ms lay said enron accounted for more than half of her firms revenue in some years she said her brothers position was more a problem than an asset since it led some to assume she hadnt worked hard enough to get enrons business

corporate ::::::>>>>>> overview of investor conference call today enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview of the company heres an update of what we discussed during the call we told investors that were doing everything we can to protect their inter ests and to regain their confidence our focus remains on our credit qualit y balance sheet and liquidity which are essential for our continued succe ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses it took more than a few weeks to get where we are today heres a snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation in hindsight we definitely made some very bad investments in our nonco re businesses over the past several years those include investments in azu rix india and brazil they have performed far worse that we could have eve r imagined when we made these investments because of these bad investments weve become overleveraged as a compa ny the negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet we also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in vestor confidence which has been very damaging weve been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hardtounder stand financial and operating disclosures and on top of it all we discovered errors in our financial statements as d iscussed in our k filing last week that required a restatement of previo usly reported earnings weve taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas core businesses noncore businesses and businesses under review core businesses our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear nings and cash flows for the company theyre our competitive advantage th ese include natural gas pipeline businesses gas and power businesses in north america and europe retail businesses in north america and europe and coal businesses in north america and europe the events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou r projected fourth quarter profitability its too early to tell at this ti me what impact this might have on our operating results we are considering these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in i also remain optimistic that the actions weve taken over the past couple of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity concerns according to our business unit leaders we have definitely seen i mprovement in our counterparty relationships noncore businesses our noncore businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d ivision we have invested more than billion in these businesses and the return from them has been dismal we have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses we alre ady have more than million in assets contracted for sale this year th ey include ceg rio a gas ldc in brazil ecoelectrica a power plant and ln g receiving terminal in puerto rico and asset sales of offshore oil and ga s properties in india the approximately billion portland general sale is also on target to close in late pending regulatory approvals businesses under review these businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets while sev eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects we need to dete rmine if their capital requirements and nearterm growth prospects are suff icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make reductions to our work force more information will follow as soon as it b ecomes available credit ratingq filing we continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that our

cooper left voicemail messages to employees on january and february since some employees do not have access to voicemail we are providing the following transcripts of those messagesstephen f cooper voicemailfriday february hi everybody this is steve cooper its about or oclock houston time friday afternoon its been a pretty hectic week but id like to take just a moment to bring everybody up to date so that everybody is fully in the loop with whats gone on this last weekbeginning last weekend the boards special investigative committee released a fairly lengthy report in fact its about odd pages and its fairly pointed and blunt the report was troubling and as im sure any number of you has seen from the various investigatory committees this week its findings have further dented our corporate history nonetheless i just wanted to let you know that my role and the job im paid to do and hopefully the job all of you are getting paid to do is to look forward and proceed that way at percent full speed i continue to believe we really have a lot to look forward tothe committee and the report didnt offer any specific recommendations rather it just compiled what they believed to be a series of facts about transactions that have been undertaken over the last several years enrons board management and creditors committee are now working together to evaluate the reports findings and take whatever action is required i like many of you am looking forward to management changes that result from these actions because to successfully to restructure the company were going to have to have a management team in place that is credible thats committed to moving forward for the future that is trusted by our outside constituents and are firmly committed to make a new enron work next week after the board meeting i hope to be able to share with you the management changes that are being contemplated and outline a team that jeffrey and myself are compiling to rebuild the companythe washington hearings this week heated up considerably and made for some either very dull or very expected or pretty interesting television viewing and obviously this has been translated into the daily headlines hopefully these investigatory processes will continue to help uncover and address any past misconduct or negligence surrounding enron and with this im sure well be able to establish appropriate safeguards for employees and shareholders going forward not only for enron but for other corporations this situation i believe will have a national impactits going to force the big five accounting firms to change the way they do business in fact it already hasits going to bring in new and more effective reporting rulesits going to put more teeth into the secarisa is going to be modifiedtheres not a doubt in my mind that congress or these committees are eventually going to look at wall street and the commercial banks and put them in their sitesduring the last week ive spent almost all my time dealing with the companys creditors committee and chatting with individual members of the committee to understand their current thinking concerns and issues so we can begin to construct with them an absolutely open agenda a free flow of information a free flow of communications and begin to work with them to develop a plan to reorganize enron as i continue to look at our various businesses im as optimistic as i was a week ago that there is a reorganizable platform here that ought to allow us if everybody is reasonable and responsible and we can begin to put some of our emotions aside to create a viable strong company that ought to be able to be successfully reorganizedin any event ill continue to keep you updated as we move forward in the meantime if you have any specific questions or comments about enron or its restructuring or anything else thats on your mind dont hesitate to either send me an email or give me a buzz and i will do the best i can to

difficult particularly with the glare of the media attention and the numerous investigations and inquiries that have been launched and continue to be launched in that environment ive got to believe its difficult if not impossible for you to focus on what lies ahead for enron and for the organizationim not going to bother to restate what is in the press release announcing my selection and our new management team this morning however id like to tell you how we typically approach situations like thisits been the experience of myself my firm my partners that in helping companies emerge from bankruptcy we look at a number of key metrics to gauge the potential for successful restructurings those metrics are typically the organization the asset base that the company has to bring to bear customer base and liquidity from what ive been able to tell over the last couple of days and with my exposure to the management team here enron has a very very bright very capable very committed hardworking and dedicated organization all of the people i have met are committed to reorganize restructure and bring enron to a successful new beginning and emerge from bankruptcynumber the physical assets look to me to be of an enormous advantage here the regulated assets the pipelines the generating plants provide steady and reliable cash flow and provide a very sound fundamental base to restructure aroundthird loyal customers most of enrons customers have continued to stand by the company and continue to take delivery of natural gas and electricity on a daily basisand fourth liquidity looks good with the cash the company has on hand the cash it expects to generate in the near term and with the backstop of the dip financing it doesnt appear that we will have any liquidity issues going forwardwith those four resources nicely in place im very confident that we can successfully restructure this company i dont want to leave the impression that it will be easy its going to be an enormous amount of work there will be upsets issues and concerns along the way but i can tell you that ive seen companies in bankruptcy that dont have nearly as strong a position as this company they were able to emerge successfully from bankruptcy and im certain enron will alsoim looking forward to working with all of you over the next few months and im very pleased to be here jeff ray and i will keep you informed on a regular basis as we move forward if there are any thoughts concerns issues that you would like to bring to my attention please dont hesitate to drop me a note or give me a callthanks so much and i look forward to working with all of you

corporate ::::::>>>>>> update on retention severance plan we know how interested all of you are in the retention severance plan so we want to update you on its status as many of you know we have been working with members of the creditors committee and their consultants since december to formulate a retention severance plan and we formally presented the plan to the committee on friday february we had hoped the committee would approve the plan quickly so that we could file it with the bankruptcy court and share the details of the plan with you before the end of the month we know that many of you have career options outside of enron and that the retention severance plan may impact your decision to stay or to leave we sincerely regret to inform you that approval of the plan for debtor companies is delayed were learning that in bankruptcy most things dont move as quickly as we are accustomed the committee outlined some concerns related to our proposed plan but we are confident we will be able to reach agreement with the creditors on those concerns the creditors committee fully supports the implementation of a retention severance plan such plans align the companys objectives with the goals of the creditors and are fairly standard in bankruptcy these plans are designed as a way to preserve and maximize value for the estate the creditors committee also understands that time is of the essence for getting a plan in place and has established a subcommittee to expedite their review and approval process to that end we are meeting regularly with the subcommittee we intend to work handinhand with them to reach agreement on an acceptable plan as quickly as possible this is currently our top priority bar none when we filed for bankruptcy we did not fully grasp how tedious the process of developing an acceptable plan would be unfortunately that lack of understanding led management to set unrealistic expectations about how quickly a plan might be in place we now know that it takes significant time resources and effort to understand identify and gather the massive volume of required details to formulate that information into a reasonable program and to prepare a rationale and compelling presentation the process mirrors the most timeintensive business presentation or deal negotiation with which enron has been involved that serves only as an explanation it is not intended as an excuse we remain committed to working with the creditors committee until we can reach agreement on a plan we anticipate that negotiation process will take another week or so and have targeted the week of march to file a motion to adopt a plan with the bankruptcy court we will continue to hold retention and severance as our number one priority until a plan is approved by the bankruptcy court with respect to nondebtor companies or those companies not in bankruptcy new severance plans are being approved and will be rolled out to employees in those companies in the very near future in the meantime we have been working to finalize merit increases and promotions across the entire organization and plan to communicate those to employees next week and of course we will update you on retention and severance as soon as possible

enron_t_s ::::::>>>>>> safety bulletin the team concept has given us numerous opportunities for improvements over the past several years with team members continuing to be recognized and rewarded for their positive efforts and accomplishments as accomplishments are made trust and responsibilities increase and the team experiences growth maturity and the associated rewardsa part of this growth and maturity must include the realization and acceptance of the teams responsibility to monitor and enforce company policies and procedures as you heard from me in i will protect those who are complying with and enforcing our requirements but i have zero tolerance for those who choose not to do so along with the rewards for positive efforts there are also consequences for those who fail to act when circumstances call for action during the year several ets employees received disciplinary action as a result of their failure to act andor ignoring safe work practices these cases were distributed to all employees in the form of a safety bulletin it has been my intention that we all learn from these instances to make our work place even safer as we publish this first and hopefully only safety bulletin in i would like to share with you two instances from last yearafter repeatedly counseling a fellow team member observed violating several safety requirements including hard hat safety glasses frc one team took action which ultimately resulted in this person being discharged while this may seem to be a harsh outcome it is much better than the person injuring themselves or even worse a fellow team member this person had others expressing concern over his wellbeing and chose to ignore the warnings individual team members acted on their responsibility and the team as a whole accepted their accountabilityin the second case a team member chose to drive a company vehicle without using a seatbelt the employee was involved in an accident ejecting him from the vehicle causing injuries that could have been prevented if the seat belt would have been properly used this employee is lucky to be alive use of seat belts by all occupants of company vehicles is one of the most basic elements of our program and has been a requirement for over years as the use of seat belts is habit forming could this have been the first time the employee failed to use them is it possible that other team members had observed this failure in the past and not acted could this have been prevented through positive interaction had positive interaction been taken but ignoredwhen the declaration of interdependence was introduced in we made the commitment to each other that we would be our brothers and sisters keeper and to remind each other of the need to comply with safety requirements at all times while some employees may feel uncomfortable enforcing our requirements that does not relieve the person from their responsibility likewise a team is responsible and accountable for the actions or lack of a required action of each team member each individual team member and the team as a whole are responsible for the outcome and any disciplinary action that management may be required to takeplease assist us in creating the safest work environment possible our most important personal goal should be to do whatever it takes to arrive home safely each and every night and should expect nothing less from peers or members of your leadership to hold you accountable for doing just that

enron_t_s ::::::>>>>>> ferc gives guardian favorable preliminary determination ferc gives high sign to wi pipe competition the northern illinois and southeastern wisconsin gas transportation markets which long have been dominated by anr pipeline moved one step closer to obtaining pipelineonpipeline competition yesterday when ferc awarded the proposed guardian pipeline llc a favorable preliminary determination on nonenvironmental issues the decision was a major win for the proposed greenfield pipeline because not only did it shoot down most of the arguments presented by anr to thwart the project but it found that even though the project would adversely affect landowner interests guardian was making reasonable efforts to mitigate the impact on landowners moreover ferc ruled that while the million pipeline would compete headtohead with anr it would not have a negative affect on the coastal pipeline and its customers on balance the commission finds that the proposed guardian pipeline will provide substantial public benefits with minimal adverse impacts the order said cp the commission also found that sufficient need was established for the inch mile pipeline that would transport dthd of gas from the chicago hub to markets in northern illinois and southern wisconsin providing customers there with an alternative to anr and access to competitive canadian gas supplies it would terminate near ixonia wi where it would interconnect with wisconsin gas cos distribution system at the chicago hub the pipeline proposes to interconnect to alliance pipeline northern border pipeline midwestern gas pipeline and natural gas pipeline co of america guardian has executed year precedent agreements with four shippers for dthd which equals about of the projects design capacity the largest shipper by far will be wisconsin gas which has committed itself to dthd of the capacity on the proposed line in fact the guardian project is an outgrowth of wisconsin gass request for proposals rfp process in june which the ldc initiated in anticipation of the expiration of its firm transportation contract with anr in october the other shippers on guardian include alliant energy dthd wps energy services inc dthd and an unnamed shipper dthd the project has a targeted inservice date of nov in multiple protests filed at the commission anr argued that guardians application was patently deficient because it didnt include the proposed lateral that wisconsin gas plans to build to interconnect with guardian wisconsin gas currently is seeking the approval of state regulators to build the lateral furthermore anr claimed wisconsin gas was using its monopoly power as a franchised ldc serving southern wisconsin to subsidize the guardian project wisconsin gass parent wicor inc is one of the sponsors of guardian the other backers are cms gas transmission and storage and viking gas transmission but ferc rejected both arguments while previous attempts to inject competition into anrs market in this area have failed we believe that this area is ripe for competition and that it is only a matter of time before other pipelines submit similar proposals to the commission we find that the proposed project will provide southeastern wisconsin with access to another source of supply which will allow this market to enjoy the benefits of pipelinetopipeline competition for the first time the order noted

enron_t_s ::::::>>>>>> safety bulletin the team concept has given us numerous opportunities for improvements over the past several years with team members continuing to be recognized and rewarded for their positive efforts and accomplishments as accomplishments are made trust and responsibilities increase and the team experiences growth maturity and the associated rewardsa part of this growth and maturity must include the realization and acceptance of the teams responsibility to monitor and enforce company policies and procedures as you heard from me in i will protect those who are complying with and enforcing our requirements but i have zero tolerance for those who choose not to do so along with the rewards for positive efforts there are also consequences for those who fail to act when circumstances call for action during the year several ets employees received disciplinary action as a result of their failure to act andor ignoring safe work practices these cases were distributed to all employees in the form of a safety bulletin it has been my intention that we all learn from these instances to make our work place even safer as we publish this first and hopefully only safety bulletin in i would like to share with you two instances from last yearafter repeatedly counseling a fellow team member observed violating several safety requirements including hard hat safety glasses frc one team took action which ultimately resulted in this person being discharged while this may seem to be a harsh outcome it is much better than the person injuring themselves or even worse a fellow team member this person had others expressing concern over his wellbeing and chose to ignore the warnings individual team members acted on their responsibility and the team as a whole accepted their accountabilityin the second case a team member chose to drive a company vehicle without using a seatbelt the employee was involved in an accident ejecting him from the vehicle causing injuries that could have been prevented if the seat belt would have been properly used this employee is lucky to be alive use of seat belts by all occupants of company vehicles is one of the most basic elements of our program and has been a requirement for over years as the use of seat belts is habit forming could this have been the first time the employee failed to use them is it possible that other team members had observed this failure in the past and not acted could this have been prevented through positive interaction had positive interaction been taken but ignoredwhen the declaration of interdependence was introduced in we made the commitment to each other that we would be our brothers and sisters keeper and to remind each other of the need to comply with safety requirements at all times while some employees may feel uncomfortable enforcing our requirements that does not relieve the person from their responsibility likewise a team is responsible and accountable for the actions or lack of a required action of each team member each individual team member and the team as a whole are responsible for the outcome and any disciplinary action that management may be required to takeplease assist us in creating the safest work environment possible our most important personal goal should be to do whatever it takes to arrive home safely each and every night and should expect nothing less from peers or members of your leadership to hold you accountable for doing just that

personal ::::::>>>>>> interesting article interesting article especially since it came from britain it doesmention enron toothe next global citythe blob that ate east texasjun st houstonfrom the economist print edition june for most outsiders texas is a foreign country its biggest city thoughmight surprise the rest of the worldwhen a texan in a big hat tells you how wonderful his home town is reachfor the salt bob lanier the former mayor of houston isnt actuallywearing a stetson as he gazes from his penthouse down on a city that sprawls miles away in every direction but metaphorically he is houston heclaims could become one of the great cities of the world the remarkablething is that he might be rightfrom the time the city was founded in until the s houston doubledin size almost every decade then despite one of the deepest slumps anycity had experienced since the s the metropolitan area managed to addm people in the s to grow to m making houston the fourthlargestcity in america it is already bigger than berlin and with a gdp of around billion a year has a larger economy than hong kong because it is thenearest metropolis to the cities of northern mexico it may attract anotherm people over the next two decades which would give it almost the samesize of population as london has now but a global city these are few andfar between houston can hardly dream of becoming a global financial centrelike london new york or tokyo but its business leaders think it couldbecome a cosmopolitan entrepreneurial hub a hong kong a san francisco oreven a new los angeles it shares las smog its sprawl its latino cultureeven its ugly hubris and by some measures it surpasses las ability toreinvent its economy can it use its adaptability to turn itself into aproperly international placeoil be there for youits hopes still depend disproportionately on its most global industryenergy accounts for half of houstons economy during the s while therest of america stagflated houston boomed as high oil prices suckedbillions into the countrys oil capital in that decade alone the citybuilt almost as much new office space as the total amount of commercialproperty available in san francisco money was being lent and business plansformed on the assumption that oil would go to a barrel at the height ofthe boom about of the citys economy was oilrelated the bust wastraumatic by the mids all that new office space stood empty everybig local bank was taken over only one of the property developers then inbusiness is leftunsurprisingly a certain paranoia lingers in the city about the oilbusiness the greater houston partnership the main business lobby hasspent the past years frantically encouraging the city to diversify yetthe fact is that the energy business and houston itself have emergedstronger from the terrible bust as company after company was forced to cutback they collapsed their operations back into houston and seem unlikely tobe dispersed again in when oil slumped to a barrel and the numberof oil rigs in america fell to its lowest point in living memory houstonstill managed to add energy jobs now another boom is in prospect with oilprices high again matt simmonds the head of a local energy consultancyargues that americas past reluctance to build new power plants will forceit to increase energy capacity by around in the next ten or yearsthe rig count is already above last year and natural gas exploration issoaring if oil prices stay high a big if and if other countries shareamericas energy worries houston will grow in importanceit is hampered by a wildcatting reputation in fact the energy business ischanging in three significant ways and houston is the centre of all ofthem first technology not long ago oil drills went down to feet metres now they go to feet companies use fourdimensionalcomputer imaging to plan new fields time is the fourth this is making oilan informationintensive business and puts a premium on the kinds of skillsavailable in houston second the cost of new oilfield exploration anddevelopment has risen so far that even newly merged behemoths cannot alwaysfinance them alone this makes dealmaking vital which is good for the citywhere deals are made if you are not attending say lunch at houstonspetroleum club you are out of the loop third and most important oil isnow only part of a bigger energy business which includes electricity oncedivided into selfcontained regional markets run by local utilities theelectricity business is being changed by the gradual emergence of a nationalgrid dominated by power producers and traders big users now decide whetherto buy power at long or shortterm rates rather as they arrange theirfinancing a new business of energy arbitraging is emerging and itscentreis houstonthree of the five new skyscrapers going up downtown have as their maintenants energy companies that did not exist ten years ago one of themenron is building a squarefoot trading floor singlecompanyanswer to the chicago board of trade enron has probably been houstonsmost successful energy company of the past ten years it has never exploredfor pumped up or refined a single drop ofoil out of the black stuffhowever wellplaced houston is to take advantage of the energy business itwill never be a great city as a onetrick pony its boosters point to otherstrengthstrade houston is americassecond largest port which is remarkableconsidering it is miles from the seacomputers the city is home to compaq americas thirdlargest pc maker ifyou include dell based in austin two of america four big computer firmsare in southeast texas not silicon valleyspace the national aeronautics and space administration centre is inhouston thanks to lyndonjohnson a native sonmedicine houston is home to probably the largest medical complex in theworld in a moment of extraordinary optimism the city set aside acresin the middle of town for medicine the hospitals clinics and researchcentres of the texas medical centre employ people and deal with patients a day st lukes has performed more heart surgery than anyother hospital in the world md anderson and the texas childrens hospitalare among the top two in their respective specialities cancerandpaediatricsthis list has holes in it houston has no real financial services themainstay of the biggest global cities or pharmaceuticals despite themedical centre and some of its new industries are less robust than theboosters claim its ports success depends on the vagaries of mexicoseconomy space does not employ many people and is unlikely to grow until thefaroff day when the commercialisation of space arrives the texas medicalcentre is set up on a notforprofit basis so it has not been able tocommercialise its activities hence the lack of drug firms though a newbiotechnology park may help in fact houstons main hope for diversifyinglies not so much in particular sectors as in something intangible itsstunning ability to create new firms for the past three years houston hascreated more new companies than any city in america it is almost certainlythe best place either to start a business or find a firsttime job thereasons for this are the real driving forces behind its success the beautyof entrepreneurialismthe first is unmeasurable a noholdsbarred optimism of the old school onesurvey shows that about twothirds of americans agree with the assertionthat if you work hard in this city eventually you will succeed buthoustons figure even at the bottom of the citys recession was and nowit is the highestever and says the surveys author stephenklineberg of rice university the highest of any bigamerican cityit may not be true that anything is possible in houston but people act asif it were bill gilmer the chief economist of the houston branch of thefederal reserve system argues that this explains why houston recovered sofast from the oil bust unemployed engineers went out and set up their ownfirms just as aerospace engineers did in los angeles when the end of thecold war put them out of business the second advantage is technicaluniquely for an american metropolis houston has no citywide zoningordinances when planning decisions are made they are made by developers ontheir own land for the wouldbe entrepreneur it is thus easier and cheaperto find a place to set up shop in houston than in any other city in americalack of zoning laws hands power to developers who insist that newdevelopments be large to capture economies of scale they expand in leapfrogfashion ignoring small acre plots near the city centre in favour of vastplanned towns further out this drives land prices sharply down especiallythe further you go from the centre on top of that an aversion to red tapemakes it easy to get building permits barton smith a land economist at theuniversity of houston reckons lack of red tape is at least as important tokeep costs low as lack of zoning lawslack of zoning also makes neighbourhoods slightly more mixed in terms ofusage residential and commercial are more muddled up than elsewhere andracially because there are no zoning laws to force say a bankruptrestaurant to reopen as a restaurant areas change shape quickly at thesame time houston is less segregated racially than any other city bymostmeasuresone should not be overimpressed by this whites in houston may be morelikely than their peers elsewhere to have had a conversation with someone ofa different race in the previous week but that hasnt stopped them headingfor the suburbs much of the racial mixture downtown is of blacks latinosand asians the city has americas secondlargest vietnamese settlementafter southern california but because zoning laws do not enable localgroups to keep poor people out for example by requiring that all housingplots be huge houston remains racially desegregated by american standardsthis helps draw in immigrant workers creating a pool of labourthat leads to the third of houstons main characteristics which should provean advantage in the st century racial tolerance houston looked like asouthern town until the s white with a large black minority ageneration later its population is roughly onethird white onethird blackand slightly over onethird brown other cities have similar profiles butnone went from a biracial to amultiracial city quite so abruptlyeven more strikingly it did so peacefully houston has not had a race riotsince for the largest southern city to have gone through thecivilrights era and its aftermath without upheaval is a remarkable commenton its politics minorities have long been fully or overrepresented in thecity council county commissions and the texas state legislature bob steinof rice university argues that unlike other growing cities houston isreinventing the tradition of a powerful group of civicminded businessleaders the fate of whose companies is closely tied to that of the cityken lay enrons chairman is an example he has been the driving forcebehind the building of two sports stadiums and has a pet project to boostchild literacy rumour has it that he may run for mayor the effect of thissort of civicminded activism showed up in the late s at a time whenamerica was busily abolishing affirmativeaction programmes houston wentthe other way it had a new one approved in a citywide referendum forbetter or worse this showed how racially tolerant it is for how muchlongerin many ways houston is thriving because it has kept alive anoldfashioned industrial mode of growth built on cheap land low taxesimmigrant labour and unfettered probusiness policies this model may not beenough in the next decadeshouston is ugly it was hardly charming to begin with and has pulled downmany of its old buildings it may have to pull down even more after recentfloods caused billionworth of damage it is also as al gore rudelypointed out during the presidential campaign polluted since cities nowhave to attract skilled workers with quality of life benefits this is a bigproblem and not one that can be overcome by cheap housingbusiness leaders are frantically trying to catch up in an unusual exampleof bipartisanship a fervently conservative property developer has joinedforces with a former member of the clinton administration to back a mbond issue to plant m trees the greater houston partnership has executedan aboutturn on pollution having argued last year that new pollutioncontrols damage growth it is now on a crash course to cut ozonecreatingemissions as fast as it can if this sudden change of mind is real itposes a tough question about zoning houston has people an acrecompared with in los angeles and in new york at the other endof the scale this extraordinary extensiveness is expensive at one pointin the early s houston alone was spending more on roads than any stateexcept california and of course texasthere are doubts about how much further sprawl can go threequarters of thebestpaid jobs are still on or within the inner ring road some new suburbsare miles away can the city continue to burst outwards while attractingthe skilled people whose jobs are downtown and surely that meansintroducing zoning lastly houston faces a severe problem in the one areawhere its national reputation is high education to run his numberonepriority mr bush picked as secretary of education rod paige a former headof the houston independent school district the president claimedcorrectly that mr paige had overseen substantial improvements in the cityseducation especially among minorities what he did not say is that theseimprovements have been nothing like enough despite successes in individualschools half of all latinos fail to graduate from high school comparedwith of whites and of blacks whites are abandoning houstons publicschools they represent only of pupils are latino more than aquarter of todays schoolchildren are likely to dropoutin a world where a good job depends on having a college degree this isalarming rice universitys mr klineberg argues that new immigrants frommexico arrive lagging further behind the rest of the country educationallythan did the wave of immigrants in the early s the first wave tookseveral generations to catch up todays immigrants will have to close abigger gap more quickly if they do not they may end up in an underclassthat could scratch at houstonsracial harmonythis is houstoncan houston make it the city has experienced the three big transformationsthat affect america in their purest form the change from a rawmaterialeconomy to services the change from a biracial to a multiracial placeand the moderation of a noholdsbarred probusiness culture to take accountof environmental and social costs elsewhere these changes have occurredover years houston has lived through them in and the next yearswill probably be just as dramatic and successful hold onto those stetsonscopyright the economist newspaper groupltd all rights

worked yesterday to find ways to bolsterconfidence in enrons weakened energy trading business asthe companies negotiators continued talks on revising theterms of their merger executives close to the talks said the renegotiated deal would cut the value of theacquisition by half they said to roughly billiondynegy they said was also prepared to invest at least anadditional million in enron on top of the billion cash infusion from dynegys biggest investorchevrontexaco included in the initial deal announced nov but dynegy wants the new cash backed by hard assets andthe companies were trying to identify and value enoughenron holdings not already mortgaged to other creditorsthe executives said before a series of financial disclosures sent enrons stockinto collapse and the company into the arms of dynegy itshouston rival enrons natural gas and electricity tradingfloors did more business than the two largest competitorscombined they also accounted for the majority of enronsprofits by far but traders and wall street analysts said the business hadsteadily deteriorated amid questions about the depths ofenrons financial straits many traders have curtaileddealings with enron and the executives close to the talkssaid dynegy officials scouring enrons books were havingdifficulty this week figuring out how much cash the tradingoperation was generating the executives close to the talks said that therenegotiated terms for dynegys acquisition of enron wouldlower the price to about dynegy share for each shareof enron cutting by half the value of the deal announcednov when dynegy offered share if a deal isstruck at dynegy share at yesterdays closing pricesdynegy would be paying about an enron share a percent premium over enrons diminished stock price thepremium was percent over enrons closing price on theday that the deal was announced both companies are seeking promises from enrons banklenders to extend debt repayment dates until after themerger closes and they are also discussing addingprovisions that could limit dynegys ability to back out ofthe combination the two companies are also working to arrange a cashinfusion of million from j p morgan chasenewsquote and citigroup newsquote that would provideenron with desperately needed new cash but there is growing concern that the cash infusion fromthe banks will not calm investors fears or reassure energytraders leading dynegy to seek an additional millionin cash for enron late yesterday the two companies werehung up over whether enron which has already used many ofits most prized assets as collateral for loans has enoughassets left to serve as collateral for the additionalmoney according to executives close to the talks a number of enron assets were being examined includingsome that have already been used to obtain other loans theexecutives said the assets include transwestern pipelinea major natural gas pipeline that links the gasproducingbasins of texas and the southwest with california enronsstake in other gas pipeline assets its percent stakeworth about million in eog resources newsquote aformer subsidiary that is now an independent publiclytraded oil and gas company and its indirect stake inhanover compressor which manufactures equipment used toincrease the pressure of natural gas and facilitate itsflow on interstate pipelines yesterday investors anxiously awaited a report by moodysinvestors service which like other major creditratingfirms currently ranks enrons debt at the lowestinvestmentgrade level if enron were to lose itsinvestmentgrade status it could be forced to repay orrefinance up to billion in debt while other traderswould probably further curtail business but by lateyesterday moodys newsquote decided not to issue astatement after receiving assurances from enron and dynegyofficials that a renegotiated deal would be announced soonthe executives said a moodys spokesman declined comment executives close to the talks said that they hoped thatnew cash from dynegy would reassure both wall street andthe energytrading markets that enrons trading floor wouldsurvive and remain a valuable asset but analysts and investors are having difficulty figuringhow much value the trading operation has already lost andhow much the business has been reduced because of creditconcerns i believe dynegy is probably seeing that deterioration inthe core business and wants to renegotiate the purchaseprice as a result said andre meade head of united statesutilities research for commerzbank securities in new yorki dont think anyone can estimate the earning power ofenron over the next three to four quarters and im notsure enron has a good estimate mr meade said he did not believe that dynegys earlierestimate that the acquisition would add cents a share toits earnings was reliable today given how sharply thebusiness seems to have deteriorated by mr meadescalculations if enrons trading volumes were to fall percent next year even if normal volume growth levelsreturned in that would wipe out nearly all the valuein the stock karen denne an enron spokeswoman said the company hadexperienced a decline in energy trading volume and in thenumber of traders doing business with it but bothstabilized yesterday she declined to elaborate or quantifythe decline she also said that enrons trading operation remainedprofitable though she could not quantify it and she alsosaid she did not know whether the company was working on apossible bankruptcy filing or other contingency plansshould its business and liquidity worsen were movingforward with the merger she said dynegy officials did not return telephone calls yesterdayshares of enron rose yesterday on news of a possiblerevised acquisition agreement they closed at up percent or cents shares of dynegy closed at up percent or though yesterdays gains halted a fourday slide in enronshares the stock is down percent this year afterdisclosures of major losses as well as significantaccounting errors that led enron to admit it overstatedprofits during the last five years by nearly million now difficulties within enrons trading operation areexacerbating the companys

c sarlat financial advisor investmentsraymond james associates member nysesipc alhambra plaza penthouse dcoral gables florida usa local toll free by andrew kelly houston nov reuters a flurry of lawsuits filed againstailing energy giant enron corp ene have highlightedpotentially devastating consequences of employee retirement plansthat lean heavily on investments in the employers stock enron workers whose jobs are at risk after rival dynegy incdyn terminated a buyout plan have lost hundreds of thousandsof dollars on enron stock held in retirement accounts wreckingdreams of a comfortable retirement for some retiree advocacy groups and attorneys said the big lossescaused by the dizzying decline in enrons share price have exposedfatal flaws in the yearold retirement accounts known as k employees are often encouraged to put a great deal of moneyin their employers stock and the result can be disastrous saidkaren ferguson off the pension rights center in washington dc seattlebased attorney lynn sargo who is pursuing one of fouremployee lawsuits against enron and a similar case againsttelecommunications equipment giant lucent technologies inclu said the law governing k plans must change it is clear that additional regulations need to be put inplace because lucent and enron are both typical examples of largeamerican corporations and if such a disaster can happen to themthen you have to ask if the current laws are adequate he said the suits filed against enron and lucent make similarallegations that executives failed in their fiduciary duty toemployees by encouraging them to invest in company stock even whenthey knew their companies faced big problems similar scenarios at enron and lucent enron and lucent both saw their share prices fall steeply amidsimilar scenarios involving a severe loss of investor confidenceallegations of murky accounting overoptimistic projections andthe sudden departures of top executives enrons stock fell from a high of in august to cents on wednesday lucents stock fell from a december highof around to a low in june of just over and wastrading at on wednesday afternoon that has been painful for people like enron employee royrinard who were invested heavily in enron stock im basically wiped out said the yearold rinard who lost over as a result of investing all of the funds inhis k retirement account in enron stock rinard says he now realizes that he broke a golden rule ofinvestment dont put all your eggs in one basket spread yourrisks by diversifying your holdings traditional defined benefit retirement plans are subject toa percent limit on investments in employer stock but there isno such limit for defined contribution plans like the k us senator barbara boxer tried a few years ago to have thesame limit apply to k plans but the measure ran intovigorous opposition from employers who wanted to retain the rightto make their matching contributions in their own stock as the rules stand companies are allowed to make all of theirmatching contributions in their own stock and workers may also putall of their own money into company stock too diversification is thwarted in many cases by regulations thatprevent employees from selling company stock before they reach acertain age in enrons case james delaplane of the american benefits council an employergroup said the k system places great responsibility forretirement savings on individual workers there are people who think thats the greatest thing sincesliced bread and there are people who think thats the worstthing he said delaplane said his organization wants to preserve employersright to contribute company stock to employee retirement plans butalso supports efforts to educate workers so that they can makebetter informed

through attacking defenses jul pm et by darryl richards foxsportscom the first national champion of the millennium will not be the product of a spaceage spread offense inspired by a mad scientist who calls himself an offensive coordinator the best college football team in america this season will run the most bas ic of offenses call the option many things plain boring ancient uninspire d but when nebraska runs it its cruel and usual punishment for opposing defenses teams may be able to slow it down but over the course of four quarters th ey will pay a price slammed repeatedly by an offensive line that averages pounds remember the limp noodles crawling out of sun devil stadium in january that was tennessees defense after the cornhuskers drove yar ds in the fourth quarter of the fiesta bowl the beauty of the system is that it is the perfect offense for the current rage of defenses using quick blitzing attacks sure you can send everybod y after the ball but the option demands you stop and think and play an assignment how do you properly scout a team that runs an offense you see only once a year the answer is you dont arguably the cornhuskers foxsportscoms no team in its preseason top were playing the best football in the country by the end of the season in their last five games the cornhuskers beat texas am kansas state colorado texas and tennessee by a cumulative score of the scary thing about nebraska is that offensive starters return for a team that finished last season the cornhuskers have an unquenchable desire to be the best again it starts in the offseason and continues through january the running game took a while to materialize last season because of injuries but iback dan alexander and quarterback eric crouch have the ability to rush for yards this season even if the oftinjured alexander cant hold up to th e pounding the cornhuskers have a replacement with great credentials and a fitting name for this smashmouth football team thunder collins nebraska will not only push other teams around the cornhuskers will push themselves the school is touting guard russ hochstein and center dominic raiola for the outland trophy presented to the nations outstanding interi or lineman the beneficiary of this internal competition is the offense this group has a great deal of confidence that always shows come august an d september said nebraska coach frank solich who has his best team since taking over for tom osborne three years ago we have a rich history and a team coming off a good season that is not questioning things we have high expectations some of it comes from how we finished last season a lot comes from playing in an excellent program and tradition the option and the huskers are inextricably bound it is their offense an d they have been running it so long it is practically an openbook test for defensive coordinators yet only eight teams have passed the test over the last seven years nebraska has won games and three national titles in th at span we try to keep up with whats current and we use the spring to experime nt solich said but our players and coaches like to line up and beat you our players that are here love it it is an aggressive style of play and that s how they want to play it its what our players want to do on offense the cornhuskers will not go through the season unchallenged crouch can put his name up there with the turner gill tommie frazier and scott frost for the title of best nebraska quarterback ever but all bets are off for this team if crouch is hurt because the cornhuskers lack depth at quarterback the schedule has its pitfalls too notre dame looking for a win that can restore luster and a reason to keep coach bob davie gets nebraska at home on sept a resurgent oklahoma team and top rival kansas state get nebraska at their places kansas state won the last time the teams met in manhattan the cornhuskers will probably play texas or oklahoma in the big championship game which has had a tendency to produce a surprise finish the cornhuskers also must shore up a secondary that loses ralph and mike brown but nebraska carlos polk back as the heart of the defense polk is heralded by nebraska insiders as the best linebacker in school history but come january nebraska will play florida state for the national title and the seminoles too will fall under the relentless attack senior

williamsetsenronenron arnie baileyetsenronenroncc randy riceotsenron morgan gottsponeretsenron darrell schoolcraftetsenron gary spragginsetsenronenron subject re pigging from p to pall of the information provided below was very informative and allows me to make the best determination as to what is the root cause of the problem i became aware of this problem a while back when doing pressure profile modeling on the panhandle lateral when evaluating proposed compression parameters for moving the nng gray interconnect to ps suction via a new mile pipeline connecting to nng pipeline hydraulics on the panhandle line indicated that efficiencies where between and which could usually be indicative of liquids in the line or phase flow walts comments below provided information that would indicate that the liquid product c may lean more on the heavier end containing more octane plus components thus where normally i would split hexane plus into mole fractions of hexane heptane and octane in this case i used a split of hexane plus using this split of c in a process model allows a closer approximation of how the gas characteristics will behave at various conditions for the purpose of this analysis the following is considered agave red bluff online gc data is used as pipeline quality of gas in panhandle lateral because gs report from owens corning delivery point is quite similar to agave gc gas temperatures will become nearly the same as ground temperatures which is provided on scada at p and p pressure and temperature profiles on the panhandle lateral at am flowing conditions are listed below the following graph attached in ms word is a phase envelope using the agave red bluff gas analysis by mapping the above relative pressuretemperature points it is clearly observed that pipeline pressure and temperature conditions approach and cross the hydrocarbon dewpoint line indicating that liquids would exist the graph clearly shows that as the pressure and temperatures move further into the envelope the more liquids will be produced that explains why more liquids are produced by pigging sections between cs p and cs p furthermore using the process model used to generate the phase envelope the model indicates that gas at psig and degf would exist in both vapor and liquid phases using a flow rate of mmcfd the liquid phase fraction would be approximately bbls per day that could amount to approximately bbls per month this liquid volume compares closely to some of the recovery volumes reported by randy and walt below lets get together on a conference call to further discuss findings and possible solutions for a first stab how about tuesday at amcst reply with availability and number of ports required ef forwarded by eric

pigging from p to p thanks randy along with the things you have stated we have a delivery point to gas company of new mexico near portales nm we do have a small scrubber there that we usually have to have hauled once a week and sometimes a couple of times the owenscorning delivery can and will get us in trouble sooner or later if we dont get a handle on liquids i have ask eric faucheaux to take a look at the system and give us some ideas on where most of the liquid is falling outi have talked with agave the producer about this and were working together to try and figure out whats going on we can pick up water on our instruments but theres not anything that we know of that will show condensate this has to be carrying through in the gas because theres not a large amount of liquids at the delivery point the best solution at this time is to get enough gas to pig the line more often after getting the liquid in at p we ran a pig from roswell to p and it came in dry as soon as the volumes come up well run from p to p then into p thanks for everyones help in this if we need a conference call to discuss let me knowit had been about six weeks between pig runs this time total received on

subject pigging from p to pgary we recently had to run a pig from p to p in order to push about barrels of condensate out of the line we had started developing problems with some deliveries off that line apparently in order to run a pig some volume has to be routed to that line i understand that there are some marketing and gas control issues when we do this but here are some operational concerns when we have to put this off or postpone itthe condensate and fluids tend to build up to the point that they carry over to a delivery point with energas this point feeds some domestic customers we dont want condensate getting into this pointthere is a customer on this line owenscorning who gets fuel from us their process is very sensitive to pressure and volume changes at any given time i am told that they have about a million dollars worth of material in production if they lose fuel the product is lost and we could be liable i am also told that once the plant goes down it could take a long time even weeks to get it back upthe owenscorning plant does not have an agreement with anyone for alternate fuel when the line has large amounts of condensate we have been asking energas to supply the plant until the pig passes the point this is in order to prevent a slug of liquid from affecting the fuel pressure the gas from energas is not measured they used to have the contract but when we got it they removed their meter setting apparently they agreed verbally to supply gas to the plant in march for a few hours when a pig was run the plant uses about mmcfd and energas was on for about hours i was notified today that energas sent us a bill for the march pig run when we used their gas for fuel obviously we will negotiate that amount but they have us at a disadvantage i can only assume that we will receive a similar bill for using them last weekend for about hourseveryone feels that if we run a pig on a regular schedule we would not get large condensate amounts into p which shuts us down by the way we would not have to use energas we would not risk pushing condensate into a delivery point and we would not incur the overtime when this happensim sure rich has some concerns also for the portion of the line in his regionwe would like to run another pig as soon as possible to see what is left in the line and then depending on what we push into p get on a regular

mind when we put pen to paper or fingers to keyboard thanks df forwarded by drew fossumetsenron on pm businessfinancial desk section adeal for use of gas pipeline stirs dispute on competitionby richard a oppel jr and lowell bergmanthe new york timespage column c new york times companyearly last year the el paso natural gas company took bids from two dozen companies for the right to ship enough natural gas through its pipeline from texas and new mexico to meet onesixth of the daily demand of energystarved california the winner el pasos sister company the el paso merchant energy company which buys sells and trades natural gas the bidding was not close el paso merchant offered twice as much for the capacity as the other companies bid in total for bits and pieceswhy pay so much more california officials who are pressing a complaint against el paso at the federal energy regulatory commission say the answer is simple the state contends that el paso merchant with help from its sister company saw the transaction as a way to manipulate the price of natural gas by using its control of pipeline capacity according to sealed documents obtained by the new york times that are part of filings in the federal case executives at el paso merchant said internally that the deal would give them more control of gas markets including the ability to influence the physical market to benefit the companys financial positions el paso executives called the accusations fanciful and in a formal response to californias complaint said the state grossly distorted company documents by quoting words and phrases out of context the dispute opens a window on an important debate about oversight of the natural gas industry which fuels a growing share of the nations electric power plants at issue is whether current safeguards do enough to prevent anticompetitive abuses in the marketing and trading of natural gas and whether federal regulators adequately enforce existing rules in particular many industry officials question whether regulated pipeline companies are able to favor unregulated sister companies that trade natural gas and are free to maximize profits more than miles of interstate pipelines crisscross the country moving natural gas from canada the southwest and other producing regions to fuel factories power utilities and heat houses not long ago many parts of the country had excess pipeline capacity but experts say that several regions including california new york and new england now face constraints as demand soars for gas to fuel power plants in california state officials and utility executives said the documents in the federal case and el pasos actions were proof that the states energy crisis stemmed not just from an illconceived deregulation plan but from price manipulation and profiteering they are the market maker with this pipeline said loretta lynch the president of the california public utilities commission which has struggled to cope with skyrocketing power prices and supply shortages el paso sets the price in california ms lynch said and what it did was intentional it has affected the price she said for everything related to heat and electrical power prices in the state californias complaint to the federal agency contends that el paso merchant has hoarded capacity and refused to attractively price unused capacity on the pipeline the state also charges that el paso natural gas the pipelines owner has had no incentive to spur competition by offering discounts to other users because the two companies are corporate siblings the state said that el paso had violated federal natural gas statutes that prohibit anticompetitive behavior the sealed filings in the el paso case indicated that the company expected to make money by widening the basis spread the difference between what gas can be bought for in producing basins of texas and new mexico at one end of the pipeline and its price on delivery to southern california as it turned out spreads widened enormously over the last year as the price of gas soared in california adding to costs for wholesale electricity that pushed the biggest utilities near bankruptcy california utilities paid billion above competitive prices for wholesale electricity over the last months state officials estimated the utilities are not allowed to recoup the costs from customers while the cost of cubic feet of gas typically is less than higher at the california end of the pipeline spot prices in the state rose to almost more than the texasnew mexico price in december to executives of the parent company the el paso corporation the accusations of market manipulation are ludicrous high gas prices in california el paso executives said in interviews are easily explained by soaring demand the poor credit standing of the states utilities and the failure of the utilities to retain pipeline capacity or store enough gas for winter the idea that anybody is holding back on california is really ridiculous said clark c smith president of el paso merchants operations in north america some el paso customers though agreed with california officials the pacific gas electric company the san franciscobased utility condemned el paso in a filing with the federal agency after its lawyers reviewed the sealed company documents it is now very clear from the business records of el paso energy corporation the utility said in the filing that the business strategy el paso merchant was authorized at the highest corporate levels to pursue involved manipulation of price spreads the agency has not ruled on californias complaint which asks that the deal between el paso natural gas and el paso merchant be invalidated based on the agencys history of policing energy providers lightly many industry observers predicted that the complaint would be dismissed perhaps as soon as the agencys public meeting on wednesday nonetheless el paso merchant is feeling some pressure the subsidiary said recently that it planned to relinquish control of all but about percent of the capacity on the pipeline to california rather than exercise an option that would have allowed it to retain the entire capacity of billion cubic feet of gas a day critics said they believed el paso made the move in hopes of lessening the chance of government action el paso executives deny that but do say that their decision was influenced by the backlash over the arrangement surrendering the pipeline capacity made for a gutwrenching decision mr smith said but was a firstclass gesture to california el paso merchant paid million to control the pipeline capacity from march until may while mr clark said he did not know the return on that investment he acknowledged that it was lucrative no doubt about it mr clark said we made good money the question of whether el pasos conduct has driven gas prices higher is expected to be scrutinized by legislators in sacramento this week the company also faces several lawsuits including one by the city of los angeles that accuse it of conspiring with other companies to prevent pipeline projects that could have eased californias energy crisis el paso denied the accusation with pipeline capacity and gas supplies tighter concerns about anticompetitive behavior have increased as price volatility has created soaring profits for energy marketers and traders dynegy inc a houstonbased energy trader was once the target of complaints to federal regulators that it had artificially raised prices by abusing capacity that it controlled on el pasos pipeline to california in a filing with regulators in january dynegy contended that pipeline companies routinely favored affiliates abuses abound because of financial windfalls difficulty of detection lengthy investigations and increased complexity of the market the company said there are some red flags right now said william l massey a member of the federal energy regulatory commission since mr massey said he was troubled by the potential for abuses when pipeline companies own gas and power marketing subsidiaries as well as electric plants fueled by natural gas el paso is in all those businesses what the commission ought to be serious about is what are the forces at work is it simply robust markets responding to true supplyanddemand signals or is it a market defined by market power and some measure of affiliate abuse he said many in the industry do not believe changes are needed there are rules in place today that protect against affiliate abuse said stanley horton chief executive for gas pipeline operations at the enron corporation and chairman of the interstate natural gas association of america the industrys trade group referring to the rules under which california has brought its complaint about el paso to its critics el paso epitomizes the competitive concerns it operates the nations largest network of interstate pipelines and owns one of the largest reserves of natural gas with its recent acquisition of the coastal corporation another large pipeline operator el paso has a market capitalization of billion at a conference at el paso headquarters in houston in february analysts heard executives predict net profits of billion this year el pasos much better known rival enron with its headquarters a few blocks away is expected to earn about billion el paso merchant provides the strongest growth two years ago the units profits before interest payments and taxes were million this year it is expected to have million in north america alone in its latest quarterly report el paso attributed those profits in part to commodity market and trading margins that were enhanced by power price volatility particularly in the western united states critics contend that el paso set out to exploit those conditions according to the sealed filings on feb the day before el paso merchant was awarded the pipeline capacity executives made a presentation to william a wise chief executive of the parent company laying out the rationale for the bid the presentation outlined what it termed strategic advantages including more control of total physical markets and the ability to influence the physical market to the benefit of any financialhedge position according to the sealed filings the passages suggested that el paso expected the deal to give it sway over the market for trading actual volumes of gas and to support financial transactions it had entered into with other parties to limit its risk for every onecent increase in the spread on gas prices the presentation said el paso merchant stood to make an additional million under the heading challenges according to the sealed filings the presentation stated that storage was needed to help manipulate physical spreads adding to the overall transportstorage cost on april according to the sealed filings el paso merchants president at the time greg g jenkins wrote a memorandum to mr wise involving an update for directors meeting later that month the memorandum stated we will make money two ways increase the load factor widen the basis spread the language appears to suggest that el paso merchant would profit by increasing the gas flow in the pipeline the load factor while increasing the difference between what gas could be bought for at one end and what it could be sold for at the other end the basis spread in an interview mr smith the el paso merchant executive said that the units prices and profits on bulk gas sales in california were locked in months in advance so that the company could not benefit from rising prices in the spot market otherwise mr smith declined to provide any details about money made on the pipeline deal or about financial terms of the transactions that locked in prices ahead of time in addition mr smith said that nearly all of el paso merchants pipeline capacity was used every day when prices spiked late last year with no capacity withheld to increase prices the company did not respond last week to a request to discuss information in the sealed documents but el paso merchant in a filing with federal regulators said californias complaint had misconstrued and incorrectly interpreted what it termed snippets of data about this report this article and others on californias energy problems are part of a joint effort with the pbs series

tw_commercial_group ::::::>>>>>> principles for generator discussion shelley im glad we made the decision to participate in todays drafting session there were only nine of us involved with ed ross skip simmons and craig c hancellor representing the generators while byron white georgia carter an d myself were there to represent the pipelines the others were with the a lliance ed was his usual self he was confidently making the good econom ic case why the pipelines should consider the generators position and how why the ferc would likely side with them craig tried to frame it commerci ally and skip played peacemaker byron and i played a little good copba d cop on behalf of the pipes with byron being the bad cop anyway sum and substance i think well be more pleased with the next draf t of this document than what was submitted to us recently the first sent ence was replaced with a more sweeping statement of intent and mission of t he parties that focused on the provisioning of the service being subject to physical operating considerations there emerged a realization that maybe two products are being contemplated here a product that blocks out a period of time for uniform deliveries say hours and a product th at basically provides the generator an option on when to take the agreed up on block of capacity it was agreed that the first product is likely to be less valuable than the second and priced accordingly byron and i argued that segmenting hourly rights should not be mandated and in fact may be physically impossible along some locations of the pipeline the generators originally intended segmenting as possibly relating to how the nurf rights were carved up by hour ex an hr block of d could be repackaged as two hr blocks of d im not sure whether we got consensus th ere or not well have to see the next draft the big ticket items nos got the most press i was troubled by the generators interpretation of both in the case of no the generators wanted to predesignate a mechanism whereby an existing customer holding a f irm service whether ft nns or storage could pursuant to the conversion formula remarket their original firm service as nurf the generators were looking at this provision as throwing a bone to existing customers who m ight want to compete with the pipeline for nurf service using capacity ex seasonal that may not be fully utilized obviously the predetermined co nversion factor was a huge problem for the pipelines as well as the whole notion of trying to fit a round peg into a square hole ie two or more dif ferent product types we pointed out the services were all different and in fact any combination of those services conceivably could be repackag ed under todays rules and sold as a proxy for nurf i believe we were suc cessful in taming that language down substantially however be on the loo kout for the next draft finally with respect to no where the generators want receipts consider ed rateable with deliveries for purposes of nurf the generators had an int ersting slant essentially ed was saying that he didnt want the pipeline s to hold the generators hostage on rates for nurf if the pipelines were th e only ones who could offer nurf by requiring the pipelines to consider r ateable receipts as meeting the nurf criteria then ed said the generators would receive the benefits of a competitive marketplace for nurflike ser vice skip pointed out that taking gas out of storage at westar in west te xas and using it as an hour by hour offset for deliveries to a power plant located at the california border was probably unworkable however he also posed the hypothet that if socalgas were to provide the same storage servi ce at the california border and those deliveries into socalgas could be adj usted to take into account the deliveries to the power plant a sort of div ersion of gas theory then the pipeline should be operationally indifferen t to whether it was providing nurf service or a rd party was providing a n urflike service they just want others to have the ability to compete wit h the pipeline of course the pipeline argued that operationally those products may not be the same moreover accepting such a nomination from socalgas could conce ivably knock off other uses of the capacity the pipeline was counting on i t lft etc as an offset which gave rise to the lower rate for the pipeli nes nurf service skip scratched out a more tame version of no and ed agreed to consider it be on the lookout for what they come up with overall as i said im glad i was there as well as the other pipeline rep resentatives i hope that we were successful in getting the generators bac k on track here ill be interested in seeing how much of our discussion t oday is embodied in

cera alertcera alert sent thu june title monthly briefingthe pressure cookerauthor n american natural gas teamemail category alertproduct line north american gas url httpwwwceracomcfmtrackeprofilecfmum pressure remains extremely strong in the united states gas market as three factorsincreasing power generation demand lower storage inventories and us wellhead supply still struggling to reboundcall into question the ability to build storage to a level adequate for next winter as strong as gas market fundamentals are gas prices are being supported also by concurrent strength in oil and liquids markets making traditional alternatives to gas much more expensive than in recent years in this environment intense competition between power generation demand and storage injections will continue throughout the summerwith pressure increasing into july as temperatures riseand gas will continue to price at the high levels necessary to discourage enduse demandthe per million british thermal units mmbtu increase in gas prices since the beginning of may has already driven responses among end users first gas is now pricing at a slight premium to residual fuel oil on the east coast and gas will likely lose approximately million cubic feet mmcf per day of demand to residual fuel oil this summer relative to last summer second several ammonia manufacturing facilities have begun to shut down equally telling however is that heat in any one region of the countrymost recently the westis all that is required to sustain gas prices above at the henry hub despite relatively moderate temperatures elsewhere and demand reductions in industrial and other power markets underlying pressures are such that prices are likely to rise on average from current levels as higher temperatures arrive for these reasons cera expects prices to average at the henry hub during july see table and even greater volatility is possible the intense competition and need to price out enduse demand mean that the market is vulnerable to spikes above per mmbtu amid heat waves this summergas storageinjections increase but little relief yetthe gas market experienced a small measure of relief in early june as storage injections finally reached a pace closer to historical averages with the american gas association aga reporting billion cubic feet bcf of injections during each of the weeks ending june and however these injections did little to reduce a deficit that is now close to bcf on a yearoveryear basis and conditions may not again be as favorable as they have been recently for injections for many weeks or even months to come as temperatures rise through the end of the month injections are likely to slow so that for june cera expects an average injection rate of approximately bcf per day the deficit that stood at an estimated bcf as of the end of may see table on an inventory level of approximately bcf is expected to rise slightly during june to bcf despite a healthy injection rate for the first nine days of the monthwith us wellhead supply still running an estimated to bcf per day below yearearlier levels and with added imports from canada just offsetting this decline even the moderate demand growth expected for july relative to last july will make reducing the deficit a difficult task each month in which this bcf deficit carries forward increases the likelihood that inventories will be at their lowest maximum ever this october injections like those in the recent two weeks would have to continue into july for this pattern to reverse in a significant way an unlikely event that would occur only under very mild weather conditionsregional marketswith the exception of the rocky mountains western differentials have been supported by waves of hot weather and extremely strong gas demand for power generation within the region this strong demand is pulling supplies from the permian and san juan basins to the west coast and has pushed up capacity utilization on the southwest pipelines into california prices at the california border have been particularly strong averaging over a premium to the henry hub so far this month continued strong western demand looks likely to support prices within the region through july as power loads remain strong and hydroelectric output declines in addition the early heat waves have begun to erode the california storage surplus although inventories in the region as a whole remain strong see table ceras outlook by region follows rockies continuing strong supply growth and low seasonal demand have pushed up exports out of the rocky mountains region high utilization rates on export pipelines will keep rocky mountain differentials wide during the rest of the summer cera expects an average july differential to the henry hub of per mmbtu san juan the pull on supplies from california has narrowed the differential between the san juan basin and the henry hub and this west coast pull looks likely to remain strong through the summer cera expects a differential between the san juan basin and the henry hub of per mmbtu during july permian and midcontinent as texas power loads increase the competition from the west coast and texas markets for permian supplies should intensify permian differentials which have been averaging around per mmbtu to the henry hub should narrow cera expects a per mmbtu differential for july midcontinent supplies should price just below permian supplies at an per mmbtu differential to the henry hub chicago chicago differentials continue to trade around per mmbtu to the henry hub and although hot weather and climbing demand within the region could put some upward pressure on those differentials ample seasonal pipeline capacity into the region will limit pressure cera expects a july differential of per mmbtu northeast new york citygate differentials have a higher floor this summer namely higher fuel costs from the gulf coast as a result of gas the result has been differentials above from transco station but closer to from the henry hub as power generation load reaches its peak however differentials can rise even in summer shortlived power load peaks may lift weekly new york differentials into the s but for the month of july cera expects the new york differential to average canadian marketsdemandstill downcanadian demand continues to be down on a yearoveryear basis volumes on transcanada pipeline are mmcf below levels at this time last year and alberta demand is mmcf below both of these reductions are primarily storage related weak storage injections driven in large part by the lack of an adequate summerwinter price spread continue to place inventories further behind levels although inventories are still well above the fiveyear average unless injections increase it is more likely that endofseason inventories will be comparable to the fiveyear average bcf rather than to levels bcfexport volumes continue to be slightly higher than last year thus far in june flows on northern border pipeline are similar to while pge gtnw is currently operating mmcf higher demand on the west coast is expected to continue this trend for the summeralberta supply build for june is likely to be flat with levels an outage pattern similar to last years has emerged tcenova has had maintenance projects ongoing in june but the supply reduction is primarily the result of plant turnarounds thus far in june reductions in supply because of maintenance have been as high as mmcf but should average mmcf for the month even though june is expected to be flat yearoveryear the fact that this maintenance reduction is less than maintenance reductions implies that a return to supply growth has not yet occurred supply is still expected to start showing growth in the second half of the year largely in the fourth quarter as a result of the increased level of drilling the annual average supply is expected to be around mmcf per day higher than in as the result of the return to growth in alberta and modest growth in british columbia again primarily later in the year as well as the new production from ft liard

l into the pipeline for a possible green energy rating and as a means of bt u enhancement since ethanol would remain a liquid at any normal pipeline conditions even atomizing the ethanol at the point of injection would not insure the ethanol from liquefying dropping out and collecting into the pipeline low spots also there were many issues concerning possible liqui ds entering the fuel systems of our equipment and other customers equipmen t planning recommended that this project not be pursued researched for marketing was the possibility of burning a methaneethanol mix in our equipment ie turbines in order to receive a green power rating solar was contacted concerning the possibility of coburning ethanol and methane as a manufacturer they said they would be willing to work with us however they only recommended it if it were to be a constant fuel source solar said there would be considerable fuel injection system retrofits required also if this were not a constant fuel then there woul d have to be two separate fuel systems coburn and methane only and a complete fuel control system change with all that the project has been deemed cost prohibitive vapor injection of

tw_commercial_group ::::::>>>>>> electric developments i consulted with kevin before i took the oars in trying to answer your question as well as the questions raised in drews email heres what we found outsteves questionwhat economics would determine if a developer could site a power plant in new mexico maybe mw and build a line to the grid in california versus us expanding to deliver the gas to a power plant in californiawhat youre really asking here is what are the comparative economics of energy delivered by wire versus energy delivered by pipeline in this analysis there are a few considerations original capital cost to construct facilities the operating cost of the facilities including energy loss and environmental and other permitting considerations engineers tell us that as a rule of thumb high voltage transmission lines and tower facilities cost approximately to mmmile to construct turnkey this figure is comparable to the mmmile rule of thumb we use for turnkey construction of mainline diameter highpressure steel pipeline in terms of operating costs for anything over miles in length there are three basic sources of energy loss in electric transmission transformation loss radiation loss efm and heat loss across the conductors a rule of thumb for electric transmission loss is this number is comparable to the actual fuel used for compression on transwesterns pipeline the most critical issue impacting construction of high voltage transmission lines is in the area of permitting there just arent many new transmission lines being approved it was suggested by more than one source that an electric transmission project on the order posited in your example could take anywhere from to years to secure authorization the issues of electromagnetic field emf radiation around high voltage power lines along with other wildlife endangerment concerns are significant obstacles in securing permits for rightofwayin short the answer is that while the economics on face appear to be comparable for construction and operation of both natural gas pipelines and electric transmission lines the protracted permitting process for electric transmission lines tips the scale considerably towards the more immediate returns available on investment in natural gas pipeline infrastructuredrews questions what are the key factors that determine where a power plant developer puts his plantfor purposes of this exercise im assuming were talking gasfired generation developers generally describe four considerations in deciding where to site a new electric power plant market area demand distributive andor transmission access to market water rights for turbine cooling ease of permitting environmental encroachment fedstatelocal regulations affected agenciesjurisdiction proximity to natural gas pipelinesupply infrastructure do the transmission access and pricing rules of the various utilitiespower pools vary all that much or are order tariffs pretty much the same all overferc order and require public utilities to commit to standards of conduct and to file open access tariffs affecting transmission among and between other utilities andor power pools in the various operating regions ferc ordered public utility transmission owners to provide transmission access and comparable service to competitors and to functionally separate their transmissionreliability functions from their wholesale merchant functions the rulemaking is analogous to the open access requirements under ferc order affecting interstate natural gas pipelines its pretty obvious from the california example this past summer that with respect to the overall operation of a deregulated power market in individual states particularly as concerns the establishment and regulation of independent system operators isos there is substantial room for improvement and possible further ferc involvement in the open access final rule order no the commission issues a single pro forma tariff describing the minimum terms and conditions of service to bring about this nondiscriminatory open access transmission service all public utilities that own control or operate interstate transmission facilities are required to offer service to others under the pro forma tariff they must also use the pro forma tariffs for their own wholesale energy sales and purchases order no also provides for the full recovery of stranded coststhat is costs that were prudently incurred to serve power customers and that could go unrecovered if these customers use open access to move to another supplier how do ipps decide what fuel supply strategy works best ie buy bundled delivered fuel from someone vs buy gas storage transport etc separatelyin my experience there is no one size fits all formula or strategy for example in the past weve seen calpine take a very handson approach to supplying its ipp projects in the mid to late s during the build out of several qfs cogens calpine bought natural gas reserves in the ground and dedicated them to the project in todays market calpine has scavenged the gas and basis traders from statoil and setup a natural gas desk for the purchase and transportation management of gas supplies needed for its western us power projects in other projects developerowners and their lenders are satisfied with a less active role in securing gas supplytransportation to the project in short projects look at the liquidity of the gas supply transportation market in deciding whether they can achieve project economics and secure reliable supply by taking bids or rfps for gas supplytransportation or whether to take a more handson approach ala calpine what is the rto rule and why should we carelast december the ferc issued order no a final rule on regional transmission organizations rtos order builds on the foundation of orders and issued in according to ferc chairman jim hoecker order makes a persuasive case for separating control of grid operations from the influence of electricity market participants therefore order can be seen as a natural outgrowth of the perceived limitations on the functional unbundling adopted in orders and continuing balkanization of the electric transmission grid based on corporate not state or regional boundaries as well as pressure to provide guidance on acceptable forms of privatelyowned transmission companies ferc prescribes a voluntary approach to rto participation the order initiates a regional collaborative process to foster rto formation the order also imposes filing requirements on the privately owned public utilities that are subject to ferc jurisdiction and requires these private utilities to describe in their filings how they have attempted to accommodate the needs of transmission owning statemunicipal cooperative and federally owned systems ferc believes that regardless of format rtos will offer the following benefits alleviate stress on the bulk power system caused by structural changes in the industry improve efficiencies in transmission grid management through better pricing and congestion management improve grid reliability remove remaining opportunities for discriminatory practices improve market performance increase coordination among state regulatory agencies cut transaction costs facilitate the success of state retail access programs and facilitate lighterhanded regulation critics point out that with its emphasis on flexibility voluntary rto formation and transmission rate reforms ie incentives order defers for casespecific disposition many of the tough issues that must be resolved in order to create an operational rto moreover order does not compel any transmission owner to join an rto but provides only regulatory guidance and incentives for willing participants as well as a veiled threat of further consequences for the holdouts as to the final part of the question why should we care presumably the development of a fullyfunctioning rto network will promote both the efficiency and market transparency goals of the original ferc orders as ferc reads it the future of gasfired generation for both merchant and utility systems depends on an efficiently operated open access transmission system therefore the promise of the rto is to stimulate competition and the ongoing investment in new generation infrastructure unfortunately sources tell me that the voluntary nature of the rto program may ultimately cripple its effectiveness in meeting its stated goals has mmbtu gas killed the gas fired power marketnatural gas prices of mmbtu can only kill gasfired power plants in those instances where there are more economical alternatives to natural gas fuel demand for electric power is offset through demand side management or natural gas in an environment of short supply is expressly prohibited from use as a power plant fuel in the western us marketplace particularly in california i see no viable alternative to natural gas fuel for electric power generation renewable resources currently meet less than of the total electric resource requirements barrel oil prices give fuel oil no clear economic advantage over natural gas even at a mmbtu price moreover california environmental and permitting regulations make the installation of new electric generation based on anything other than natural gas fuel or renewable resources virtually impossible while demand side management programs are the politically correct approach to meeting resource needs historically they have served only a minor role in offsetting the growth in electric power as to the final point im unable to comment on the risk of future legalregulatory restrictions governing the use of natural gas as a boiler or turbine fuelsteven

tw_commercial_group ::::::>>>>>> bad proposed decision attached below is the cpucs proposed decision in the gas industry restructuring proceeding essentially it adopts the interim proposal with a few modifications the cpuc states that they are taking a cautious approach to deregulation in light of recent market events in both electrici ty and gas and therefore rejected the more robust reforms outlined in the comprehensive settlement the cs was offered by socal gas and supported by many of the settlement parties including enron and transwestern the good news is that with respect to hector road the maximum volume at hector is limited to mmcfd similar to the proposal made by the comprehensive settlement ive included the section from the pd that deals with this issue for your convenience the full document is also attached excerpt at at page regarding hector road receipt points intrastate transmission as we have already discussed above we now judge that intrastate transmissi on unbundling is not wise at this time for the socalgas system however socalgas intrastate transmission system can still be made more accessib le and understandable to its users in r the record reflects dissatisfaction among customers and shippers with the lack of clarity on how socalgas schedules gas shipments through its windowing system and socalgas sole use of the hector road interconnection as a receipt point exh in r pp southern california edison company market conditions report panel heari ng testimony of mr paul carpenter southern california edison tr pp jan our decision in d directed investigatio n into using the hector road interconnection even on an interim basis and t he publication of socalgas windowing criteria in tariffs socalgas filed advice letter which detailed its process of basing a maximum amount o f gas scheduled for shipment through a receipt point on the prior days nominations except at the first of the month early in the instant proceeding the alj held in abeyance active consideration of the windowing procedure tariff socalgas filed pending the resolution we reach today prehearing conference of september p we are approving on an interim basis the replacement of the current windowi ng process with a system under which socalgas will establish receipt point capacities subject to daily revision on the basis of the physical maximum s for each receipt point under the operating conditions expected for that day customers and shippers will know the daily maximums because they will be posted on socalgas gasselect system daily prior to the nomination deadlines if in the aggregate customers nominate more than the physical capacity at any receipt point gas will be scheduled based on the upstream pipelines capacity rights system for wheeler ridge at which more tha n one upstream pipeline delivers gas the maximum daily physical capacity would b e allocated between upstream sources pro rata on the basis of the prior day s scheduled deliveries from each source this system eliminates the mystery in how prorations are made provides continuity in capacity rights between the interstate and intrastate systems and provides flexibility for customers in nominating at the most costeffective receipt point on any given day we recognize that it does n ot provide for longterm planning but the alternative under the cs of paidfo r firm receipt point rights for the term of the settlement has the disadvanta ge of locking customers into a receipt point that may lose value over the term in this period of gas price volatility we believe that the more flexible plan is the right one thus we direct socalgas to withdraw advice letter and file a new advi ce letter within business days implementing the proposed receipt point physical capacity system this may be the same as the exemplary tariff fil ed with the is or updated as necessary pursuant to subsequent proceedings th is tariff revision will be effective within days after the filing unless rejected by the energy division in r pge and edison particularly complained about the restrictions at wheeler ridge exh in r pp pge rebuttal to market conditions report and exh in r pp southern california edison market conditions report one response in th e is to these complaints is the establishment of a formal receipt point at hector road for all customers subject to wheeler ridge access fees and surcharges its capacity will be mmcfd or greater as long as there are nominations of that volume and mojave pipeline company delivers that much i n response to those nominations this provision should allow greater flexibility for shippers and customers as well as leveling the playing fiel d between socalgas and others at this interconnection we will support socalgas application to the federal energy regulatory commission for approval of hector road as a formal delivery point by mojave el paso natural gas company objected strongly to the provision in the is fo r automatically expanding of wheeler ridge capacity while this was not an option specifically mentioned in d we do not choose to stand on that technicality to exclude it from consideration here once a proceeding is open to settlement the dynamics of settlement talks may bring in matter s outside the delineated scope as they have done here with regard to wheeler ridge expansion and for instance pooling both proposals respond to concerns raised in r see citations in text above as well as pan el hearing testimony of mr benjamin c campbell pge tr pp jan and neither was specifically excluded from further consideration in d we therefore view them as within the scope of this proceeding to the extent that other receipt points are also viewed as constrained we welcome evidence to that effect in a future proceeding as well as proposal s for criteria to determine when expansion should be applied for by mmcf d if a certain number of curtailments occurred and for automatically allowin g the expenses of that expansion to be rolled into rates we do not wish to approve automatic rate increases for all ratepayers for a facility for whic h only some may have use but we believe that developing criteria for expansi on of receipt points is useful hector road may not entirely alleviate the problem of constraints on northern gas flowing to the south therefore we approve that portion of section iii of the is that sets forth criteria for expansion but provide that upon the meeting of that criteria socalgas shall submit an application for an expansion of the receipt point capacity that application shall be processed in the regular way with the issues of need in the context of the entire system and foreseeable market conditions considered moreover rolledin or incremental rates allocati on of cost among classes and consequent rate design will remain open for decision in that proceeding thus the modification to the is that we make is in the first sentence of t he first full paragraph on page the words apply to should be inser ted after socalgas will we specifically disapprove the is language in the middle on page beginning with the words this settlement through t he end of the paragraph and the concomitant language in appendix a setting the co st at million in dollars forwarded by jeffery fawcettetsenron on am from jeff dasovich on pm sent by jeff dasovich to jeffery

tw_commercial_group ::::::>>>>>> more info on higher gas prices enron talking pointsfactors leading to higher natural gas prices this winter demand for natural gas has increased mainly due to consumption in the power generation market and strength of the manufacturing sector in a booming economy natural gas production and drilling has fallen off since due to low prices that reached far below per mmbtu in deliverability utilization will be over percent while drilling activity has risen sharply as much as from last year the production from this increased drilling activity typically is not available for several months according to the aga supply production continues to run below last years levels the past three winters have been warmer than normal winters in the midwest and much of the united states and canada artificially masking the usual consumption of natural gas under normal weather situations very warm weather during this summer has caused a significant demand increase for natural gas in the electricity generation sector thereby competing for gas storage injections in the marketplace and driving prices upward us storage inventory levels are lower than historical average levels from the past six years according to the aga the cost of storage inventory at this summers strong prices could eliminate the price advantage traditionally experienced in the winter other heating fuels like propane and heating oil are also showing significantly higher prices and potentially lower stocks this winter than last

tw_commercial_group ::::::>>>>>> proposed decision the gd article today regarding the proposed decision is a pretty good reade rs digest version of the order susan and i spoke with jeff dasovich and mark baldwin yesterday and the consensus of those conversations was that transwestern should remain involved in this proceeding only for purposes of implementationdocumentation jeff offered that he might send a letter to governor grays office expressing both dismay and indignation that the cpuc didnt complete their task and warning of the adverse outcome to california ratepayers if these more modest reforms are approved he may ask the other comprehensive settlement parties to join in signing the letter susan mar k and i spoke about this idea later and weve got some reservations about tw s role in admonishing the cpuc we should probably wait to see this letter first before committing to anything bilas draft cautious toward socal competition mindful of the current chaos over energy markets in the state california public utilities commissioner richard bilas has recommended the adoption of a much more moderate approach to promoting competition on southern california gas socal sy stem in his draft decision bilas advised the commission to reject the unbundlin g of intrastate transmission and instead approve the first settlement filed in the case th e less farreaching interim settlement is submitted in december socal san diego gas a nd electric and other parties filed two more settlements after the is reaching a comprehensive agreement in april this year but since then gas and power prices skyrocketed in the state prompting a consumer backlash and giving competition a bad name the draft language notes that the first interim settlement was supported by more customer groups than the later agreements recent events lead us to conclude that the centerpiece of this investigation the unbundling of intrastate transmission and the implementation of a system of firm tradable intrastate transmission rights should be delayed according t o the draft order this unbundling is the basis of the comprehensive settle ment and we cannot approve it we do not however wish to commit to paralysis until as the postinterim settlement would have us do accordingly we believe californians are better served at this juncture by the adoption with modifications of the is the biggest change to the is in the draft is the rejection of an automatic capacity expansion by socal at wheeler ridge calif with rolledin rates if certain criteria are met el paso energy had objected to the provision in the is that would have allowed soca l to automatically expand capacity at wheeler ridge by million cfd if a certain number of curtailments occurred el paso objected to forcing all shippers to pay for the expansion at wheele r when only certain customers would benefit the draft says socal can file a separate application for the wheeler ridge expansion but approval would be conditioned on a traditional hearing proce ss the draft decision would also end socals current windowing process which limits shipp ers ability to change nominations for deliveries between receipt points on the system it is replaced with an announced daily calculation of capacity available at each receipt point establish hector road as a formal receipt point for nominations institute an operational flow order ofo procedure provides a foru m for more changes in ofo procedures if excessive ofos are made set up pools of gas on the socal transmission system that ar e intended to increase the liquidity of gas trading make changes to balancing rules while retaining the current mon thly imbalance tolerance make socals own gas acquisition unit subject to the same balanci ng rules and penalties as all other shippers allow some limited imbalances trading as well as the right to assig n and reassign unbundled storage contract in a secondary market with a socal electronic bulletin board set up for it unbundle from core transportation rates the storage capacity cost ex ceeding that required for core minimum reliability and provide for rate recovery of up to million in implementation co sts in addition the draft would unbundle core interstate transportation from rates eliminate core contribution to noncore interstate transition cost surcharges elimina te the core subscription option as well as the caps for core aggregation programs the threshold fo r participating in core aggregation is reduced and billing options are offered to core aggregators bilas draft also warned that the commission may come back in two years to open another investigation into gas competition taking into account any changes in mark et conditions bilas gave a little more insight into his decision in the text of the draft the cost of gas as a commodity has vastly increased at the border show ing a differential between the basin and border prices that is more than the cost of transport and related services we question whether there will be an opportunity for discounting by markete rs if more competition is allowed bilas wrote in the draft decision with half the state already committ ed to a restructured competitive natural gas industry it suddenly seems as if the benefits of such re structuring to enhance competition are speculative particularly at this time with one leg in the water the current has switched direction and it will be difficult if not foolhardy to reach our goals by forging ahead we choose to take a cautious approach again the draft continues rather than proceeding to unbundle transmission in southern california now we approve with modifications the settle ment suggesting smaller steps towards a competitive market additionally w e unbundle core interstate transmission and once again urge the legislature to pass consume r protection legisla tion aimed at unregulated marketers while we facilitate growth in core aggregation programs the cpuc would not rule out the unbundling of intrastate transmission and other restruc turing in the future but believe that at this point in time the certain benefits do not outweigh the costs to most ratepayers all drafts must be filed days before the meetings at which they will be discussed the draft decision is currently on the agenda for the cpucs dec meeting

crist a lecturer with igt is preparing a daylong seminar customized to our interests and issues here is my top list on why gpg staff need to increase our understanding of the electric industryfirst and foremost gasfired electric generation is the growth market for gas pipelines we need to get a sense of why and where generation is being built and who the likely customers are this involves understanding the different between utility generation and merchant plants the dynamics of siting understanding a little bit about how utilities plan and economically justify generation investmentssecond we need to understand electric utilities as customers who is the customer these days the generator who should we be dealing with within the utility organization what types of load patterns should we expect various types of electric players what types of services do they need we also need to get a sense of how the timing of their processes comparecontrast to our processes on the gas sidethird we need to understand the regulatory climate on the electric side and the implications for electric generation demand growth we need to understand the statefederal jurisdictional issues we need to learn about the debates over atc tlr locational marginal pricing price caps and control areas we need to understand how these issues fit into enrons position in support of restructuring the electric industry unbundling transmission removing native load exceptions and avoiding prices caps and we need to understand how these debates affect gpg fourth we need to understand electric tariffs and practices services and oasis because the ferc has started to insist on common rules between gas and electric the recent electric interconnection policy has now been applied on the gas side ferc is talking about imposing the rto principles on pipelines and we hear a lot of comparisons between oasis and pipeline ebbs we want to learn how to take advantage of electric best practices where it makes sense and on the flip side know how to argue against the imposition of electric rules on our pipelines where there are legitimate differences between gas and electricive shared this list of interests

tw_commercial_group ::::::>>>>>> caithness big sandy llc tw and caithness met in denver this week for the first facetoface meeting between the parties the purpose of the meeting was to review the status of the caithness big sandy project and to establish the next steps for moving the project forwardcaithness corporationcaithness corp is a privately held company based in new york with a variety of business interests the company is essentially a financial vehicle for private investors their energy segment currently owns mw of generation through renewable assets in california geothermal at coso wind in tehachapi and palm springs and a gas fired plant in south carolina jointlyowned by florida power lightbig sandy projectthe big sandy project is a proposed power plant to be located near wickieup arizona the project would be built in two phases first phase would be mw with a gas load of approx mmbtud and phase would add another mw for a total of mw with a gas load of mmbtudthe proposed location of the plant is approximately miles south of transwesterns pipeline the takeoff point on transwestern would be atnear valve station approximately miles downstream of compressor station the current estimate includes an alignment that follows arizona state highway south to a location miles southeast of wickieup in the sw of section tn rw mohave county arizona there is a kv transmission line owned by wapa that crosses the property this line is one of the principal electric transmission systems in the southwest and extends from the phoenix area to the mead substation near boulder city nv ive included a wapa map below which indicates this line also on the site is a water pipeline owned by the cyprus amax bagdad mine water for the plant will come from an encapusulated water table through deep wells they have currently dug the first two test wells each capable of cfm the power plant will require approximately cfm of water in addition to the wells the plant has several thousandacre feet of water rights to surface water from the big sandy river the project may also purchase water from the cyprus bagdad water pipelinethe chief geological feature of this area is the big sandy river and associated wash the highway roadbed follows along the river the area includes rolling hills and is principally desert terrain with some limited agricultural and ranching interests wickieup is a very small town with an estimated population of project schedulegas turbines ordered westinghouseseimens may submit environmental impact statement eis august arrange financing december eis approval march construction begins april testing begins july commercial operation november there are two lead agencies for purposes of the projects eis the bureau of land management blm kingman office and the western area power administration wapa there is only one endangeredthreatened species known to be present in the arealateral pipeline alignmentthe most critical path item is the alignment of the lateral pipeline the alignment lateral pipeline route must be included in the eis to be filed next month caithness has spoken preliminarily with the arizona department of transportation adot and the agency is amenable to granting an easement for the pipeline the problem appears to be in the limited amount of right of way available measured from the shoulder to the fenceline there is only a ft right of way available for construction typically pipelines require a ft temporary construction easement and ft of permanent right of way preliminary discussions indicate another problem with this alignment may be the roadways routing within the wash of the riverbedif the highway corridor is unsuitable for the pipeline the second alternative appears to be running the pipeline down the adjacent ns section line the problem with this approach is that as the line nears the site the routing would have to contend with the river bed and wash areas possibly necessitating deep burial and anchoring the other route would involve following along the wapa electric transmission corridor the only issue there aside from whether wapa would permit the pipeline encroachment is whether there are safety andor corrosion concerns associated with a high pressure gas line located under a high voltage transmission systemother preliminary project issuesthere are other fundamental issues to address the original concept was to interconnect the proposed transwestern lateral with el pasos northern mainline and the yettobeconstructed questar southern trails pipeline both of which lay adjacent to transwesterns mainline transwesterns original estimate to construct a lateral pipeline and meter station mm was based on the following specifications mmcfd psig delivery pressure psig inlet pressurethe meeting resulted in a revised set of specifications that now include a higher psig minimum delivery pressure new technology westinghouse turbines in addition our understanding is that epngs system operates at a pressure psig lower than transwesterns in order to accommodate epng deliveries and to account for the new higher minimum pressure the design will likely change to a

butch russell in albuquerque so should be ready this week the electrical drawings are being done by frances balderas in omaha and be ready by this weeks end my understanding is that pogo will build the facility per our specs and we will operate it they wont purchase materials until their well comes in pogo anticipates the well should be completed in about a week and a halfjust to recap we will need a chromatograph sulphur monitor water monitor flow control positive shutin and a means of overpressure protection the chromatograph will require commercial electricity operation of the facility without the above will have to be approved by rich jollygeorge kneisley do you have any input not mentioned abovein speaking with you yesterday i think all of these are covered but just want to make

proposed decision and comment points for filing on friday below are his comments which we can use for discussion purposes at the conference call later this morning having reviewed the proposed decision i would agree with marks assessment in that while we may prefer that the commission not modify the comprehensive settlement overall the modifications made should not negatively impact transwestern the proposed decision retains two important aspects of the cs for transwestern unbundling of the socal backbone transmission system and receipt point capacity and retention of primary firm rp capacity of mmd at needles from transwestern gh original messagefrom mbaldwinigservicecomenron sent tuesday october pmto hass glensubject bilas proposed decision socal girgleni have reviewed the revised pd of comr bilas as requested in viewof the entirety of tws interest i still ascertain that tw can support thecurrent pd noted below for your information and review is a summaryof the modifications to the csa that bilas is currently offering market concentration limits reduced from to of available receiptpoint capacity tw has preferred no limits to market concentrationhistorically however as before i do not believe pushing this issue willbe successful or productive for tw there are no market concentration limitsin the secondary market although bilas warns market participants that anymisbehavior will be subject to cpuc investigation psocal will be required to make available on a daily basis any unutilizedfirm rp capacity i dont see any negative impact on tw perhaps positivepprice cap for secondary intrastate market set at of socal firm ratethis is the same cap that applies to socal i dont like the precedent setin this area however it assures that the economic value allocation betweensocal citygate and supply basin will proportionately tend toward theinterstate system providers in any tight transportsupply scenario pnot really a change but bilas mentions support for hector rd as adeliveryreceipt at fercpd does not reduce the cores interstate capacity nor their storagecapacities but rather maintains these capacities at current levels currentlevel mmcfd proposed mmcfd on the interstate system and currentstorage bcf mmcfd of injection and mmcfd withdrawal vsproposed bcf i see no clear negative impact on tw from this changep ctas core transport agents

allocated only to those noncore customer usingthis service and not to the core customers i see no impact on tw ppd rejects the requirement that socalsdge file an application with aproposal to address

of customers from core to core aggregator noimpact on tw ppd orders a cap on itcs stranded costresponsibility borne bybundled core customers due to unbundled core interstate capacity no directimpact upon tw interest however likely a touchy point with noncoreinterest p pd orders that the core contribution to noncore itcs will end effectivethe adoption of the pd additionally noncore customers to pay of coreitcs till the end of the core tw and epng agreements no negative impact ontw noncore customers bear additional expense the pd estimates anadditional million over next to years p the pd provides anestimate of increased stranded cost for the noncore between and to beapprox million pd say no to an increase in the core brokerage fee of to cents no impact on tw interest p pd treats core subscription service differently on an accounting basisno impact on tw pgenerally the pd makes some administrative changes to the small coreespmarket rules and socal services and consumer protection implementation noimpact on tw interest p lots of tweaking on how socal can recover the cost to implement toservices envisioned under the csa owing to the fact that socal has alreadystarted to implement portions of the csa and those cost are accruing to abalancing account etc bottomline not consequential to the approval of thepd no direct impact upon tw interest p on whole the centerpiece of tws interest in this proceeding remains intactthe socal receipt points are unbundled along with socal backbonefacilities tw has primary firm rp of no less than mmfcd mojave isrecognized at only mmfcd firm rp no receipt point complex is given apreference for capacity expansion line appears to remain useful for twdeliveries into the market load centers the pd modifications to the csa donot impose upon tw any conditions or costs that would be reason not tosupport the pd the parties most affected by the pd are the core aggregatorswith additional costs and restrictions to service options and noncorecustomers with additional cost allocationspoints for comments tw agrees with the pd that the centerpiece of positive changes embodiedin the csa in the creation of firm tradable rp rights this change in socalmarket structure provides all market participants with the proper tools tobuild long term supply and transportation contracts further adoption of the pd substantially reduces unnecessary marketinefficiencies at the california border by providing all market participantswith gas scheduling certainty the creation of tradable secondary rights on socals intrastate systemwill promote competition and generally lead to stable delivered gas prices the pd correctly observes that the pge market structure which relievesupon an unbundled intrastate backbone system work relatively well duringcalifornias challenging energy marketstw agrees that the time is ripe for approval of the pd the energy marketsin california have been improving and stabilizing the commission promisingoptions are still valid in todays gas market further socal is alreadystarting to follow the csa game plan in their attempts to improve theoperating environment on the socal system it is consistent to followthrough and make the structural changes required to make permanent theseimprovementstw supports socal and others whom are approving this pd on this pointtw should be sure that

tw_commercial_group ::::::>>>>>> pge ferc article ferc extends investigation of negotiated rate agreements between pge gas t ransmission northwest and shippers looking for evidence of market manipula tion foster natural gas report page c copyright foster associates inc ferc issued an order in midmonth september that set for hearing certain co nsolidated proceedings involving several negotiated rate transactions betwe en pge gas transmission northwest corporation rp and various ship pers the commission believes closer scrutiny is called for because these t ransactions appear to provide the opportunity to impose rates many multiple s in excess of maximum approved tariff rates the commission had issued a suspension order in each proceeding that among other things directed gtn to explain how it had the firm capacity ava ilable to move gas under the transactions in these proceedings and why its entering into the subject negotiated service agreements did not violat e regulations and policy regarding firm transportation service and negotiat ed rate agreements the new expedited hearing procedures are intended to fu rther explore these matters pending the outcome gtn must revise both its tariff and capacity availability postings to provide for clear identificati on of operational capacity and must post and contract operational capacity on each day of its availability ie on a daytoday basis unless it c an demonstrate such capacity will be available for some longer period of ti me questions same as those addressed to transwestern earlier fercs concerns in this case are remarkably similar to fts deals recently arranged by transwestern pipeline co rp that are now the subject of an expedited hearing and investigation beginning in january trans western made a series of eight filings implementing fts negotiated transa ctions with five shippers the filings were accepted and suspended subject to conditions by orders issued march and and april staff issued data requests to transwestern sempra and richardson in the march orde r ferc also directed transwestern to show cause why its negotiated rate tr ansactions did not violate the regulations transwestern answered that the negotiated rate contracts at issue and any others for that matter would n ot have been any less firm or provided a lower quality of service had shipp ers elected instead to pay the recourse rate underlying these transactio ns transwestern said is capacity that becomes available only for a short time in july the commissioners voted to establish the hearing to further explore transwestern s negotiated transactions that tied rates to gas spot market price differentials between the california border and producing basins in new mexico and west texas for service to the border sempra energy trading corp richardson products co bp energy co astra power llc and reliant energy services elected to pay transwestern negotiated rates as high as mmbtu compared to a maximum fts recourse rate of centsmmbtu excl uding surcharges and fuel in transwestern s case the commission expressed the belief that closer sc rutiny of transactions that provide the opportunity to impose rates many mu ltiples in excess of maximum approved tariff rates is necessary did trans western withhold capacity that otherwise could have been made available und er recourse service in order to make the capacity available under negotiate d rate charges at substantially higher rates see report no pp background beginning in march gtn made a series of separate filings pursuant to its rights to implement various negotiated rate transactions under its fts rate schedule with sempra dynegy marketing and trade relian t energy services canada ltd western gas resources western ens erco energy inc mirant americas energy marketing lp bp ener gy co and ceg energy options inc the filings were accepted and sus pended subject to further proceedings by orders issued on and the transactions established transportation rates ti ed to natural gas spot market price differentials between the northwest pip eline interconnection at stanfield oregon and the pacific gas and electric co and tuscarora gas transmission co interconnection at malin on the or egoncalifornia border according to the data collected by ferc the negotiated rate transactions w ould yield average daily transportation rates many multiples of the maximum fts rate approximately mmbtu stanfield to malin exclusive of surcharges and fuel based on the publicly reported price differentials at the contract receipt and delivery points during the term of the contracts the commission initiated additional review procedures to further explore qu estions regarding conditions under which operational transportation capacit y may be available on the gtn system gtn has already told the commission that all negotiated rate shippers knew service was available at the recourse rate but that these shippers chose t o structure the pricing of their contracts in this distinct fashion anyway further gtn insists the subject firm capacity was posted as available on the companys website and ebb consistent with the commissions regulations pursuant to the suspension order ferc received the following information sempra clarified that mmbtud of its mmbtud total capacity arrangement with gtn was subscribed at the fts rate but gtn insists sem pra requested firm backhaul service with the intent of reversing the path under the negotiated alternative sempra was persuaded it would not have to pay reservation charges on the full mdq for a secondary lower priority re verse path service in its response sempra asserted it wanted to use the c apacity on a secondary basis and thus chose to negotiate a rate structure t hat would best reflect its price risk profile to account for the fact that the capacity may not be available every day further sempra stated that th e gas transported was sold into the daily markets at malin pges citygate or the southern california border market dynegys rationale for choosing a rate formula rather than the fts reco urse rate was to gain additional value from the capacity gtn had suggested it could enter into a negotiated agreement based on the daily indextoind ex spread because the stanfieldmalin spread less fuel did not cover the cost of the fts recourse rate based on gtns information dynegy believe d the price spread was expected to widen and thereby would give it a prici ng opportunity according to western it initially sought mmbtud of capacity at t he fts recourse rate but gtns response did not allow for the total volu me to be shipped at that rate instead gtn proposed and western accepted a nother price option mmbtud at the fts recourse rate and m mbtud at the negotiated gas daily index rate neither reliant nor enserco filed a response to the commissions o rder mirant cited three reasons for choosing the monthly index spread rather t han the recourse rate the index spread was easily hedged at the tim e the market spread was more desirable and reduction of market risk mi rant believed there were no other practical options to move gas from stanfi eld to malin gtn established four negotiated rate agreements with two different shippe rs bp energy and ceg energy the bp energy agreement was accepted as propo sed but ferc accepted and suspended the ceg energy agreements subject to r efund and further information similar to the other parties ceg energy sta ted that it chose a negotiated rate rather than the recourse rate because i t believed the index spread was less expensive than the fts recourse rate ferc has serious concerns according to the september order gtns negotiated rate transactions und er investigation present several serious concerns even with the addition al information in hand the commission concludes that the filings raise man y issues that need to be investigated further accordingly an expedited he aring should explore issues including but not limited to whether the tran sportation capacity was advertised and awarded in an accurate and fair mann er consistent with gtns tariff whether the rates negotiated by gtn were t he product of an exercise of market power ie did gtn withhold capacity that otherwise could have been made available under recourse service just t o make the capacity available under negotiated higher rates why the shipp ers agreed to these rates when lower recourse rates should have been availa ble and lastly whether the practice of improving a shippers standing in the scheduling process by selling firm transportation to undesirable prima ry points so an alternative point can be nominated is discriminatory agains t interruptible transportation shippers since the alternative point is als o available on a somewhat bestefforts basis since the negotiated rate transactions also raise concerns regarding gtns posting procedures and its use of firm service contracts for operational ca pacity the commission also spelled out the need to require gtn to undertak e immediately certain measures to identify more clearly the operational cap acity available on the gtn system and the period for which such capacity is awarded finally the commission discovered discrepancies between gtn and the other negotiated parties representations regarding the capacity quantities avail able at the fts recourse rate specifically fercs concerns go to the se mpra and western rate agreements whereby the parties initially desired mmbtud at the recourse rate but were provided with a combination of rec ourse service and a negotiated service these actions by gtn may reflect th e exercise of market power and manipulation of the capacity market the com mission surmises mark mcconnell transwestern pipeline company office

unit at the san juan compressor station pin overview for those uninvolved to date in a walk through of the san juan station with the team thursday eveni ng it was noted that severe settling issues on yard piping existed t he team had been working with engineering on developing an action plan to a ddress over the last several months upon a visual inspection we requested that the team contact a local contractor and have the pipe cover dirt re moved immediately to allow the piping to relieve itself this would provid e the necessary time to follow up with engineering and attain feedback on t he status of the project and implement remedies the team had a contractor on location the following monday and work removing the cover was com pleted this monday however the expected results were not achieved in other words the piping did not spring back to the degree that pipe stre ss concerns were eliminated we requested that a structural engineer be se nt to the site immediately to evaluate the integrity of the piping he was on location thursday morning in a phone conversation with phil di ckenson trigon structural engineer he mentioned that his immediate concer n was how this much displacement could not induce high stresses however no pipe coating cracks were visible so he wanted an opportunity to input th e data in a model and evaluate prior to making any recommendations he did offer that at a minimum we stand a good chance of exceeding the desig n factor but without reviewing the data further he would not commit to a c onclusion we asked that he work through the evening if required to prov ide the necessary information with regards to the pipes integrity while waiting on trigons report we notified the team and asked that they contact foutz bursham local pipeline contractor and get an evaluation from the m on the estimated down time it would require in a worst case scenario to m ake the repairsreplacements to days we then requested that the ro swell cdc ernie delossantos determine the availability of approximately of x wall pipe ea y wall s and ea y wall all material is available at redman supply in farmington conclusion mr dickenson called with the results this morning and informed us tha t we appear to be exceeding allowable stress levels the stress levels cal culated by dickinson were in excess of yield as follows of smys at the connection between the recyclesurge line and the discharge header and of smys at the elbow immediately outside the building wall on the recycle line his recommendation was that the piping be cut and rewel ded to return the piping to a lower stress condition and that suitable pipe supports not subject to subsidence be provided conference calls with engineering spalding eisenstein rance pebdan i minnoti were set up to review the data with mr dickenson and it wa s decided to have greg mcilwain on location monday in conjunction with mike mccracken to initiate the necessary repairs after much discussion with d ickenson with regards to the modeling performed engineering indicated that the system is operational and therefore we will remain loaded until early next week when repairs are made the repairs will be isolated to the un it only so the downtime is not expected to exceed days hours howe ver furhter evaluation by mcilwain will confirm timelines if anyone has questions through the weekend prior to

tw_commercial_group ::::::>>>>>> fw new report on lessons from california fyi kimoriginal messagefrom gold amy mailtoagoldcoralenergycomsent wednesday august amto watson kimberlysubject fw new report on lessons from californiai just got this and thought you might find it interesting as wellamy inline attachment follows from ericehirstcomto ericehirstcomdate wednesday august gmtsubject dear colleaguethe edison electric institute just published a paper the californiaelectricity crisis lessons for other states which i wrote the paper isavailable on the publications page of my website wwwehirstcomhttpwwwehirstcom please let me know if you have any comments onthe paperhere is a summary of the paper california was supposed to show the rest of the nation a brighterelectricity future that future as outlined by the california publicutilities commission in envisioned an electricity industry featuringcompetitive markets such markets were intended to produce lower costs andmore choices for consumers while ensuring profits for efficient energysuppliers and encouraging the retirement of old inefficient power plants although the first two years of restructuring beginning in april seemed to bear out these promises the last year has been a disasterfor californias electricity consumers taxpayers and electric utilitiespart of the fallout from californias electricity crisis is considerableconcerneven oppositionin other states to restructuring the electricityindustry although a few states have decided based on the californiaexperience not to restructure i believe that is the wrong outcomeinstead the primary lessons other states should learn from california arethat competitive markets can work competition is not to blame forcalifornias problems and basic economic principles of supply demand andprices affect market outcomes section of this paper briefly reviews the history of electricityregulation and restructuring in california and the problems that occurredbeginning in may section the heart of this paper offers guidanceto other states on the key ingredients of a competitive electricityindustry this section makes several points maintain a favorable investment and regulatory climate for newgeneration to ensure that enough generation capacity is online and plannedto meet growing loads ensure that enough infrastructure transmission capacity and naturalgas pipeline capacity is in place and planned to meet growing loadsmaintain reliability connect new generators to the grid support largeregional markets and provide fuel to power plants encourage retail customers to participate in dynamicpricing andvoluntaryloadreduction programs ie couple retail and wholesalemarkets create honest retail competition avoid standardoffer rates withartificial discounts and create conditions that encourage many companies tooffer retail services without favoring individual competitors encourage electricity suppliers to manage and diversify their supplyand price risks create efficient and integrated wholesale markets for energyancillary services and transmission congestion monitor and minimize horizontal market power generation andvertical market power combined ownership and operation of generation andtransmission ultimately competitive markets for electricity will lower costs andprices better align consumer prices with producer costs improve producerefficiency in both investment and operation maintain or improvereliability and yield greater innovation in customer services and pricingoptions but this transition from one industry structure to another isturning out to be long and complicated it is complicated becauseelectricity is so important to our modern hightech society electricity isour most flexible fuel providing light heat motive power and the energyto operate all our electronic equipment also electricity truly is arealtime product for which production and consumption must occur at thesame time although the problems that have occurred in california aresubstantial and worrisome regulators and legislators in other states shouldfocus on the longterm benefits of competitive electricity markets andaccept the possible shortterm problems that may occur they also need torecognize that wholesale markets are regional in scope and extend far beyondthe boundaries of any single state finally competition in retail andwholesale markets must be coordinated in particular it is not possible tohave competitive wholesale markets unless at least some retail load facestime varying prices if states restructure properly to create competitive markets forwholesale energy and retail services we should all benefit consumers willenjoy lower prices they will have many more choices of energy services andpricerisk tradeoffs reliability will be improved because most reliabilityservices will be obtained through markets instead of by engineering edictand the financial risks associated with building and operating power plantswill be assigned properly to investors rather than consumers ericeric hirst consulting in electricindustry restructuring capital circleoak ridge tn phone fax

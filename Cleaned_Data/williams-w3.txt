steve palmer mark a pr comnes alan badeer robert williams iii bill mallory chris denne karen belden tim yoder christian sanders richard bsubject as the caiso turns caiso involved in scam with cdwr to purchase excess power from cdwrs longterm contractseveryonethis is hot news showing that the caisocdwr relationship is even more cozy than we thought i am not sure how to best use this information but this scam needs to be brought to the publics and fercs attention according to two sources the caiso is helping to bail gov davis out of his highpriced cdwr longterm power contracts by purchasing cdwrs excess energy as an out of market purchaseinstead of purchasing realtime energy from the caisos supplemental energy auction as required by the caiso tariff the costs of purchasing this highcost power is being charged to scheduling coordinators who are largely unaware of the caisos surreptitious transactions this sweetheart deal violates the caiso tariff which requires the caiso to buy energy from its supplemental energy realtime auction first caiso tariff dispatch protocol section d only after the caiso has used up the supplemental energy bids can the caiso buy out of market oom energy if the caiso were following the tariff cdwrs excess energy would be treated as an uninstructed deviation and cdwr would be paid the clearing price for supplemental energywhich is often as low as therefore under the tariff the caiso could have paid cdwr the same price paid to other scs but instead is buying it at a price agreeable to cdwr by ignoring supplemental energy bids in favor of cdwr power the caiso is able to manipulate the price it pays for energy in the supplemental energy market low caiso demand for supplemental energy drives down prices the clearing price for supplemental energy has often been as low as therefore the caiso gets to keep all excess energy on the grid for free if cdwr was not getting preferential treatment its energy would be treated as excess energy and it would get little or nothing for it while there is no evidence that gov davis has directed the caiso to buy from cdwr first this behavior clearly benefits davis absent the caisos purchases of cdwrs excess energy cdwr would be forced to sell its energy at a huge loss in the open market just like many other suppliers the media has been been making hay out of daviss strategy of buying high and selling low therefore davis and cdwr benefit by being able to offset some of their losses under the longterm contracts of course they are only able to offset their losses through a backdoor deal with the caiso the costs of this expensive cdwr power are being passed through to unwitting scheduling coordinators who frequently seeing minute ex post prices of expect that the cost of imbalance energy will be close to these scs are in for a big surprise according to one source at sierra pacific the caiso charged him as much as mwh for imbalance energy where is the price mitigation here who benefits under this scam davis and cdwr who loses under this scam instate generators who are currently obligated to sell to the caiso scheduling coordinators who overgenerate or that have negative imbalances consumers who end up paying higher prices for energy sources our client representative from the caiso has confirmed this practice and the friday burrito an industry insider publication mentioned it also here is the quote from the friday burritothere is another problem that is being introduced by the longterm contracts the iso is utilizing the dwr contracts as out of market oom calls thereby forcing the contract energy into the grid ahead of the supplemental energy bids in the balancing energy ex post beep market as one of our faithful observers told me the iso will be billing some drwcers longterm contracts to scs as oom energy this has been confirmed by the iso this means there is no realtime price transparency we may see an hourly expost price of say but this will bear no

bill_williams_iii ::::::>>>>>> as the caiso turns caiso involved in scam with cdwr to purchase excess power from cdwrs longterm contracts everyonethis is hot news showing that the caisocdwr relationship is even more cozy than we thought i am not sure how to best use this information but this scam needs to be brought to the publics and fercs attention according to two sources the caiso is helping to bail gov davis out of his highpriced cdwr longterm power contracts by purchasing cdwrs excess energy as an out of market purchaseinstead of purchasing realtime energy from the caisos supplemental energy auction as required by the caiso tariff the costs of purchasing this highcost power is being charged to scheduling coordinators who are largely unaware of the caisos surreptitious transactions this sweetheart deal violates the caiso tariff which requires the caiso to buy energy from its supplemental energy realtime auction first caiso tariff dispatch protocol section d only after the caiso has used up the supplemental energy bids can the caiso buy out of market oom energy if the caiso were following the tariff cdwrs excess energy would be treated as an uninstructed deviation and cdwr would be paid the clearing price for supplemental energywhich is often as low as therefore under the tariff the caiso could have paid cdwr the same price paid to other scs but instead is buying it at a price agreeable to cdwr by ignoring supplemental energy bids in favor of cdwr power the caiso is able to manipulate the price it pays for energy in the supplemental energy market low caiso demand for supplemental energy drives down prices the clearing price for supplemental energy has often been as low as therefore the caiso gets to keep all excess energy on the grid for free if cdwr was not getting preferential treatment its energy would be treated as excess energy and it would get little or nothing for it while there is no evidence that gov davis has directed the caiso to buy from cdwr first this behavior clearly benefits davis absent the caisos purchases of cdwrs excess energy cdwr would be forced to sell its energy at a huge loss in the open market just like many other suppliers the media has been been making hay out of daviss strategy of buying high and selling low therefore davis and cdwr benefit by being able to offset some of their losses under the longterm contracts of course they are only able to offset their losses through a backdoor deal with the caiso the costs of this expensive cdwr power are being passed through to unwitting scheduling coordinators who frequently seeing minute ex post prices of expect that the cost of imbalance energy will be close to these scs are in for a big surprise according to one source at sierra pacific the caiso charged him as much as mwh for imbalance energy where is the price mitigation here who benefits under this scam davis and cdwr who loses under this scam instate generators who are currently obligated to sell to the caiso scheduling coordinators who overgenerate or that have negative imbalances consumers who end up paying higher prices for energy sources our client representative from the caiso has confirmed this practice and the friday burrito an industry insider publication mentioned it also here is the quote from the friday burritothere is another problem that is being introduced by the longterm contracts the iso is utilizing the dwr contracts as out of market oom calls thereby forcing the contract energy into the grid ahead of the supplemental energy bids in the balancing energy ex post beep market as one of our faithful observers told me the iso will be billing some drwcers longterm contracts to scs as oom energy this has been confirmed by the iso this means there is no realtime price transparency we may see an hourly expost price of say but this will bear no resemblance to the eventual realtime settlement price there is no way to estimate what the oom charge was as the iso doesnt post that information the implication is that parties buying realtime energy will wait days before theyhave any idea of the price this sort of price

newswires washington dow jonesfour of the five california department of water resources power traders fired last month for conflict of interest reasons had access to the state electricity grid operators control room that revelation was contained in a recent letter to the house government reform committee from terry winter the california independent system operators president and chief executive the letter responded to house lawmakers concerns voiced during an aug hearing about dwr power traders having access to the isos control room floor and the wealth of marketsensitive information available there rep doug ose rcalif who chairs the committees energy policy panel said access to the isos control room allowed dwr traders to cherrypick power purchases and led federal regulators to exclude dwr purchases from consideration in a recent landmark refund order the five fired dwr traders owned stock in calpine corp cpn investmentsquotessymbolcpn news

constantine louie and peggy chung the fifth richard ferreiro wasnt among those winter listed as having controlroom access neither did elaine griffin who resigned after it was learned she owned calpine stock they were among dwr employees who had their controlroom access privileges terminated by the iso over the past two months the others had their badges deactivated because they either hadnt filed necessary confidentiality statements or hadnt been using their badges to access the iso control room said stephanie mccorkle an iso spokeswoman nine dwr power traders still enjoy access to the iso control room according to winters letter to ose among them is bernard barretto who reportedly owns stock in enron corp ene investmentsquotessymbolene news investmentsnewssymbolene msgs investmentsdiscusssymbolene steve maviglio a spokesman for california gov gray davis who recently sold calpine stock after conflictofinterest concerns were raised said earlier this month that barrettos investment met state ethics rules because enron wasnt making sales in the spot market where the dwr employee was involved in making power purchases dwr employees investments are thoroughly reviewed to make sure there are no conflicts dwr spokesman oscar hidalgo said employees must either divest their stock or recuse themselves from deals that involve their financial interests hidalgo said an ose spokesman yier shi said the congressman believes the arrangement has worked against the interests of california consumers its pretty obvious that it isnt in the interest of california consumers the dwr or the iso to have that conflict of interest in the powerpurchasing process shi said why is dwr getting preferential access thats the core issue shi added allowing dwr power traders into the iso control room is a real conflict because dwr is the major buyer in the state said lynne church president of the electric power supply association whose members include many of the companies that own power plants in california having access to the control room gives them intelligence on what sellers into shorterterm markets are charging including whats being sold and to whom church said any kind of buyer or seller would give their eye teeth for that kind of access she said noting that no other grid operator in the country allows that sort of access its just unconscionable for them to have that kind of access to market intelligence during the aug hearing that ose chaired winter agreed that having dwr employees in the control room was a problem the iso is working very hard to get them out he said the access was provided back in january after the dwr was forced to begin purchasing what since then has amounted to about billion in power on behalf of the states

intent to be there on a permanent basis said hidalgo the dwr spokesman who described the privilege as a temporary move to keep the lights on now that the states electricity crisis has lessened the

questions on a widevariety of topics from all over the world recently aweb visitor posed a question that many of us face often as our own children are establishing themselvesas adults were faced with issues relating to care forolder relativesheres our readers question and our responseconvincing elders to accept carequestion as a hospitalgeriatric social worker bothin my personal and work life i am frequently asked thefollowing question my elderly parent auntneighbor clearly needs some help at home butrefuses this help even if free or done by a familymember a church how can i convince this personto accept helpafter ive determined that the issue isnt financialusually a solvable problem then i am frequently at aloss the situations ive seen like this seem to onlyresolve after a crisis occurs and the person has nochoice how would you approach a situation like this theissues seem to revolve around pride retaining controldenial of illness aging or disability anythoughtsresponse in his notes from the undergrounddostoevsky wrote human behavior is motivated by thecraving for absolute freedom and selfassertion indefiance of all dictates of reason as decrepitudetakes its toll on our bodies and minds oftenpride is the only thing we have leftwaiting for a crisis is excruciating for folks whothink of themselves as caregivers when it comes toorganizing care for people who have less and lesscapacity to take care of themselves or their personalsurroundingsprobably the wisest thing to do is ask a whole lot ofquestions using the example of children of an elderlyparent first the concerned children need to askthemselves what are their own interests do they wantto assuage guilt do they fear that harm will come totheir parent are they concerned that a crisis willinterrupt the normal course of their own livesquestions also need to be asked of the parent whatmost concerns you about your situation healthcomfortable surroundings companionship your capacityto hold your head up and say daughter please i cando it myself one can also ask what do you thinkare the standards that determine ones capacity to livean independent lifethis questioning approach brings the parties intofuller participation in the decisionmaking process when i ask you a question it means i am taking youseriously the reverse is equally true innegotiation this technique is called active listeningthe crucial element is listening closely to all theelements of the responses to those questions both thequestions one asks oneself and the questions asked ofother people it is no less important to respond towhat people say by checking to make sure youveunderstood their points you may want to say this iswhat i understood you to have said is my understandingcorrect you also want to indicate the fact that iunderstand what you have said does not necessarily meani agree with youclinging on to the visual indicators of independence isa critical vital sign the fear of loving relativesthat something bad can happen has to be balancedagainst the knowledge that if you kick someone in theirselfesteem you are attacking a most vulnerable partof their anatomy you cannot negotiate away a personsselfesteem but you can destroy it through frontal andflanking attacksthe frustration faced by folks who see loved onesfailing to take proper care of themselves isphenomenal very often the people who have advocatedprofessional care ultimately must mutter hopefully tothemselves the unsatisfying statement i told yousoin your question you indicate that crisis forceschoice perhaps the best approach is to prepare asafety net that is ready when the crisis occurs itcannot prevent a crisis from happening and it iscrucial to make sure that a crisis is not worsened byforcing the victim of it to lose face but havingthat safety net ready can at least reduce the force ofthe fallrelationship is one of the seven most significantissues to consider in negotiation focusing on therelationship with an elderly parent or friend notletting decrepitude get in the way of love and caringcan make it much easier when someones selfesteem isattacked by a crisis looking at oneself and

bill_williams_iii ::::::>>>>>> pure political phony an interesting anecdote about your good friend gray this man in his official capacity has no nexus with the issue of power or energy and he has no nexus with the issue of ethics or conflict of interests south asserted hes a pure political phonythe staterenewed ethics attacks put davis on the defensive politics the governors conflictofinterest problems with his energy advisors give gop rival bill jones a ray of hope for his struggling campaign by mark z barabak times political writerin when gray davis first ran for governor his republican rival tested a series of attacks on davis ethical conductthere were charges that he improperly used state workers in a previous campaign accusations that he placed cronies on the state payroll and questions about possible conflicts surrounding davis voracious fundraising activitiesbut when voters heard the allegations they simply shrugged them off the response was hes a politician of course he does stuff like that recalled one gop strategist who sat in on the voter interviews conducted for republican nominee dan lungren the campaign shelved its line of attack and democrat davis romped to a landslide victorynow he is under renewed assault for alleged ethical lapses this time surrounding the states electricity crisis the issue has put the governor and his campaign aides on the defensive just as the states power crunch appears to have finally easedthe charges have also invigorated the struggling campaign of bill jones the republican secretary of state and davis sole declared rival in the race for governor last week jones called the conflictofinterest allegations one of the most significant pervasive and costly ethics scandals in california historybut as yet there has been no evidence of profiteering on the part of davis energy advisors let alone the governor himself and unless there is some proof many observers doubt that the revelations will seriously set back the governors reelection prospects in november i dont see this becoming a dominant campaign issue said jim knox executive director of california common cause the good government group and one of davis most prominent critics its likely that the more resonant issue is going to be how well the overall crisis was resolved or not resolvedthat said knox worries that the controversy will only contribute to the corrosive cynicism turned up in lungrens focus group interviewsthe danger is that this could undermine the publics confidence in state governments ability to resolve this crisis in their best interest knox said it does surprise me that the governors office with all of its experience and talent could so cavalierly disregard the states conflictofinterest laws which to me appears to be what happenedthe controversy involves nearly a dozen davis administration officials with financial ties to some of the major energy companies doing business in california their investments surfaced months after the officials should have filed economic disclosure statementsrevelations that resulted in part from jones pressure five of them have been fired and others are facing state or federal investigationsgarry south the governors chief political strategist points to the firings as evidence of davis probity clearly if the governors office did not feel there was a conflict of interest there they would not have been fired south saidas for others in the administration who may have failed to promptly disclose their ties to the energy industry there is absolutely nothing illegal about anyone on the governors staffor anyone in state governmentowning stock in any company whatsoever south saideven so davis top spokesman steve maviglio earlier this month sold his shares of stock in a california power company after news of his holdings surfaced maviglio said he lost in the transactionat the least the revelations have been a distraction for davis at a time when he would rather boast about a blackoutfree summerit is a mistake that didnt need to be made and shouldnt have been made said gale kaufman a sacramento campaign consultant and one of the rare democratic strategists willing to publicly criticize the governor the fact that it took a while to correct it creates an image problem he didnt needrepublicans of course see a larger problemhes either incompetent or there is corruption within his administration said rob stutzman a spokesman for the california republican party and we think it starts with the tone and example he sets with those who work for himin characteristically pugnacious fashion the davis campaign has sought to turn jones charges around by accusing the secretary of state of exploiting his public office for political gainthis man in his official capacity has no nexus with the issue of power or energy and he has no nexus with the issue of ethics or conflict of interests south asserted hes a pure political phonybut jones said political oversight falls well within his purview as the states chief elections officer for the governors office to say that i dont have any jurisdiction in this area or shouldnt be able to speak to it is patently false jones saidnew life for jones campaignwhatever his stake there is no question that the attention has given life to jones campaign while he is fighting desperately to sustain his gubernatorial bidthe in contributions that jones reported for the first six months of the year is embarrassingly small by california standards and the bush white house has all but formally endorsed rival richard riordan who is still exploring the racefellow republican william e simon jr a los angeles investment banker has been campaigning for governor for months but has yet to officially declare his candidacybut ironically for all jones efforts it may be riordan who is best able to capitalize on the ethics controversy unlike simon a political neophyte and jones an year officeholder riordan had a decadeslong business career before serving two terms as los angeles mayorhes cut from a different cloth said don sipple a gop strategist who is neutral in the governors race if this serves to remind people that politics is a slimy game riordan can point to the fact he didnt start public service until he was more than years oldbut even while insisting that davis did nothing wrong strategists say voters will make a careful distinction between the governors professional conduct and any evidence of personal enrichment and davis best defense they argue is his famously modest lifestylea frugality symbolized during his campaign by his cramped west hollywood homeif anyone thinks davis has used his office to get rich one advisor said all wife sharon has to do is throw open the door to their condo

officials turned to a technique called sleeving they used lees old long beach firm mieco inc and allegheny power to camouflage the states identity as the buyerchaosinexperience hobbled power buyersstate electricity purchasers often finished second against veteran industry tradersby daryl kelley and jeffrey l rabintimes staff writersaugust it was the night before the darkest day of the winter energy crisis when californias first wave of rolling blackouts paralyzed cities from bakersfield to eurekadavis administration strategists were huddled in a sacramento office that january evening trying to figure how to keep the lights on when a speeding tractortrailer slammed into the capitol like a runaway traini looked out the window and saw the flames and the smoke rising said ray hart head of the energy planning team the symbolism was not lost on himthe next day with the states electricity supply on the line and the governors political career on the blink hart was called on to create an organization that overnight would become the biggest power buyer in the west purchasing electricity for million customers whose utilities were going brokenow seven months and billions of dollars later the administration is under fire for paying top dollar for a cadre of inexperienced traders who at times have been exploited by veterans in the cutthroat energy industry even gov gray davis acknowledges the mismatchits like the yankees playing a stickball team he said in a recent interview were totally out of our leaguethe administrations new longterm contracts also have been criticized for paying too much for power that may not be needed in the futuremaking matters worse nearly a dozen consultants hired by the administration owned stock in energy companiesa fact revealed only after they were belatedly asked to file personal financial statements five were hastily fired and the federal government is investigating possible insider trading violationshow an agency could forget conflictofinterest codes or ignore them is beyond me said doug heller of the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights in santa monica this is the way people lose faith in governmenthart said it never occurred to him that consultants and buyers in his vastly broadened organization should file declarations of financial interest until requests for the information rolled in including one from davis republican political rival secretary of state bill jonesamid all the controversy of recent days hart said the efforts of his staff in helping to avoid blackouts so far this summer have been overshadowedfrankly said hart a veteran administrator with the state department of water resources its kind of disconcerting we arent getting the credit we should be gettingpatching together a team on the flythe states new energybuying organization was a beg borrow and recruit operation a core group already was working in the department of water resources to buy power for the massive canal pumps of the state water projectthe agency received an immediate infusion of million to create its expanded trading arm of employees and consultantson the fly hart patched together a team of retired state energy buyers workers from a closed energy exchange and analysts from pacific gas electric southern california edison and the energy industrymany were hired to buy electricity on the spot market after repeatedly calling power companies throughout the west to negotiate prices then they needed to schedule its use on a statewide monitoring system that reflects supply and demandfrom the start the administration said it would pay higher wages than usual to attract talented traders who could hold their own against wily veterans at private energy marketing firmsenergy trading and purchasing is a very complex business with millions of dollars of energy purchased every day a state budget document said it is important to recognize the level of risk and the high level of expertise that is necessary to effectively manage that risk and operate the program effectively professionals in this business are highly compensatedpower buyer william mead was among the first to get the call in early februarythey said can you be up here tuesday said mead a yearold former edison engineer from duarte i said for a job interview and they said no bring enough stuff for several months they told him to bring his last paycheck and a resume mead said he worked six weeks he said before he finally got a contract to signin those early days it was chaos because we were always at stage on the verge of blackouts he said there was no focus other than to keep the lights on one day mead said he bought of all power consumed on the states electricity grid during his hour shiftbut unlike mead most of the new crew had never bought power before according to their resumes most worked at the nowdefunct california power exchange an energy trading floor similar to a stock market reconciling sales and purchases made by others before that one worked at a freightforwarding company in carson and another ran china noodle house in arcadiaenergy industry insiders said they have spotted a series of rookie moves by the new grouptheyre just buying too much or buying too little or buying too much too fast said mark palmer spokesman for houstonbased enron corp one of the nations largest energy marketers its like someone who flies a kite one day and then is told to go fly a the nextone veteran said the state traders lack the practiced subtlety that experience brings you dont just come out to someone and say whats your price and then pay it but thats what some of them have donea senior analyst at a california firm that sells power to the state traders said the word i get from our traders is that a lot of them have made a lot of money off thempalmer said california for the salaries its paying could have done bettera particular lightning rod for criticism is the twoyear contract of chief trader susan t lee who was hired in april for an hourwith barely a years experience in the energy industry she leads a person crew that buys electricity the day before its needed or for nearly immediate use state records show that lee was paid more than a month including overtime as she began her new dutiesthat ladys got one years experience and shes getting grand palmer said an experienced trader in private industry he said might make to in a good year plus bonusesshes certainly making double what i am but shes worth it said hart who has spent two decades as a bureaucrat at the onceobscure department of water resourcesalthough lee could not be reached for comment hart said her short tenure in the industry must be judged by the reality of todays evolving trading market california energy deregulation began only in and energy trading has changed enormously in just the last year he said i would argue that somebody who has been involved and engaged for the last year has as much value as anybody regardless of experiencelees team members meanwhile have been signed to lucrative shortterm contracts worth a maximum of to a month including housing rental cars per diem pay and flights home on days off state records show that many traders have actually received only about half that maximum amountone industry trading manager said he knew nearly all of the new state traders from their work at the power exchange he said several had applied to him for a job after the exchange closed in january but he didnt think they were qualifiedsome traders acknowledge feeling overmatched against veterans of the industry and have had to learn on the job how to competethey know more than me theyve seen it all said state trader bernard barretto a navy electronics technician before he got a job at the power exchange in in their own defense the traders also said they had virtually no leverage in their early months because power reserves were so depleted that they had to buy no matter the costour job was to buy whatever we could buy former trader elaine griffin said california was truly a captive markethart says the relative inexperience of his traders hardly matters because they follow strategies devised by higherupsdo the traders go out and start the deal yes hart said do they cut the final deal nofar from the trading trenches the governor sees things differently the trading arms of companies such as enron far surpass that of the department of water resources he saidthese are very sophisticated operations davis said they have several meteorologists and banks of media peopleto protect taxpayer money from being devoured by these savvy private traders in the early days of californias powerbuying binge state officials turned to a technique called sleeving they used lees old long beach firm mieco inc and allegheny power to camouflage the states identity as the buyerthe technique also allowed california to buy power from companies that had questioned whether the state would pay its billssome traders however saw through the guise the volume of energy being bought on the market by mieco and allegheny was the tipoff that california had weighed ini knew it and im pretty sure the rest of the traders out there know about it too said one trader who like others asked not to be named because he still trades power with the state but it worked for a while it helped keep the shortterm prices downcontroversy over stock holdingsthe state traders were powerless however to protect themselvesjust as they were settling into their new jobs and energy prices were falling the administration was stung by the disclosures that of its traders and consultants owned energy stocks the governor ordered them to divest the holdings within hours or be firedfive were ousted anyway because they had previously bought power for the state from a firmsan josebased calpine corpin which they had owned stockthe highestranking of them was former sacramento utility executive richard ferreira who was hired on a contract in january to negotiate longterm power contractsthe four others were the veteran mead and three younger buyers herman leung constantine louie and peggy cheng elaine griffin who had resigned just days before the firings also held calpine stock while trading for the statemost of the traders who had worked together at the power exchange in alhambra said they bought the stock before they went to work for the state and had never been warned that ownership was a problem they said no one asked if they even held any energy sharesmead said traders on his state teamsuch as cheng leung and louiehad no ability to influence calpines stock price because their purchases of the companys electricity were infrequent and smallmead said he had openly touted calpine stock to his colleagues because hed made so much money on it he said his investments of in and last fall brought him about when he was ordered to sell last monthyou want to know how i picked calpine he said investors business daily has a system for selecting stocks and calpine showed up on its list of stocks with strong potentialleung said he rarely dealt with calpine and bought his worth of shares on jan while still at the power exchange which had a conflictofinterest policy barring ownership of energy stocki didnt know i would have an opportunity like this at the time leung said of his briefly held state job i bought it just because im interested in the market all the time i follow ittoday shipped back home from their rented apartments outside sacramento the fired traders see themselves as victims of davis effort to fend off further criticisms of his handling of the energy crisisthey bristle at the fact that davis has not required some of his most influential private advisors to file the kind of disclosure statements that led to their firingsthe big boys the ones hiding behind the right not to disclose those are the ones that ought to be drawing attention mead

insights on what happened that day let dave perrino or sue mara knowthanksalan officials study grids close call published friday aug in the san jose mercury news by steve johnson john woolfolk and glennda chui mercury news two energy agencies announced thursday that they are investigating charges some california generators have disregarded orders to provide electricity and atlantabased mirant admitted it had a role in last weeks incident that briefly imperiled the western power gridcalifornia officials said two companies failed to deliver expected power on aug and pushed the grid dangerously close to collapse threatening outages on the electrical lifeline to million people but it could take state and federal officials some time to sort through conflicting accounts of what led to the power shortfall and how to prevent it from happening again some generators and a federal official questioned the california independent system operators handling of the emergency and said the rules governing how power plants must respond to state orders for supplying electricity need to be clarifiedbut stephanie mccorkle with the california agency said the incident was just the latest in a series in which generators didnt follow orders and she said state officials are particularly troubled at the reasons some of the firms involved have offered for falling short on delivering promised electricity``we asked them over and over why theyre not following our dispatch instructions she said adding that some have provided ``explanations that dont add up it makes us suspiciousmccorkle said the aug incident occurred when two power companies balked at state orders to provide power that left the western grid a vast network of highvoltage lines transformers and other electrical gear that spans states and parts of canada and mexico with a sudden and severe electrical shortage if uncorrected she and others said it could have led to widespread power outagesalthough officials need to keep the grids electrical frequency at hertz the aug shortage lowered it to hertz state officials said blackouts could occur at hertzmccorkle declined to name the companies involved but patrick dorinson a spokesman for mirant which has three plants in the bay area said it was partly responsible while offering few details about what happened he blamed the incident on an inadvertent error by a company employee ``not making a timely call and ``some software problems with our computers``it happens dorinson said ``people make mistakesan official with the federal energy regulatory commission one of the agencies investigating the matter said it views the aug incident with alarm and wants to ensure the problem doesnt happen again the agency also intends to look into whether penalties are in order but at this point the official said its unclear whether the problem stemmed from confusion incompetence or attempts to manipulate market prices the official said the agency also wants to know why the california independent system operator didnt declare a statewide emergency on aug when the promised electricity wasnt delivered had it done so he said the agency would have had more leverage over the generatorssome power company representatives complained that the iso doesnt always give generators enough time to get their plants warmed up sufficiently to provide the power it needs for many plants ``it takes a lot longer than minutes to ramp up said richard wheatley a spokesman with reliant energy of houston ``you physically cant do itbut iso officials defended their procedures and spokesman gregg fishman said issuing an emergency declaration on aug wouldnt have been feasible``this was so quick he said ``it was less than half an hour total from start to finish and we were able to deal with it appropriately without suffering blackoutsthe incident also is being looked into by the western systems coordinating council a voluntary confederation of energy suppliers and utility officials which sets rules for managing grids in the regions nearly million square milesrobert dintelman the agencys assistant executive director said brief electricity fluctuations such as the one that hit california or worse occur once or twice a month across the west on aug for example the frequency dipped to in montana when an electrical disturbance forced a large power plant offline there dintelman saidbut he said californias claim that generators arent following orders is unusual ``that is alarming he addedthe council can issue fines for some rule violations but dintelman said hes not sure if they can be levied for defying orders to deliver powernationally such violators typically get away with little more than a slap on the wrist because penalties are so weak said ellen vancko of the north american electric reliability council her group has been pushing congress to make the system tougher but the legislation has stalled meanwhile she said grid rule violations appear to be on the rise nationwidealthough the motivation for these incidents varies she said sometimes those responsible break the rules for no other reason than to benefit themselves ``even if it means dragging down the frequency on the entire grid and putting everybody at riskcontact steve johnson at sjohnsonsjmercurycom or

bill_williams_iii ::::::>>>>>> forward obligations report issues bill following are two glitches the real time group has run across with the forward obs report as i understand dave poston is getting set to roll out a new version of enpower position manager which may eventually take the place of many of the reports we run forward obs included but in the meantime these are the problems weve seen thanks so much for your help on this report not reading two identical strips when deals are extended in scheduling for the same hours same volume same price and same counterparty using the same deal number the report only reads one strip for example on deal was previously entered as a sale to the california imbalance for mw he and two separate but identical strips of mw for he the report read all mw he but only mw he i zeroed out one mw strip and aggregated it with the other so the report would read all mw another example on deal is a purchase from ees he which was also entered as two separate strips of mw each again the report read only one of these and i eventually zeroed out one strip and aggregated it with the other so the report would read a total of mw for those hoursdue to the nature of real time deal entry high volume and a lot of deal extension in scheduling it would be impractical to aggregate volumes within deals that fall in the same hours at the same price so im hoping this can be remedied by tweaking the report to read strips with identical terms please let me know if this is feasible report not reading sales at the bc border this is a new one that cropped up this morning we made a purchase from a counterparty at the bpa busbar wheeled the power to the bc border and sold it there for some reason although all three deals appear in deal entry and scheduling the sale at the bc border does not show up in the forward obligation report after looking into this ive found no deal entry errors and can only conclude that deal is simply not pulling into the report im wondering if this is related to deals done at the bc border although i dont recall seeing this problem beforeagain please let me know when and if these report problems can be addressed i look forward to our next conference callthankskate symesreal time trading support

bill_williams_iii ::::::>>>>>> iso complains to ferc that generators are ignoring dispatch orders  published thursday aug in the san jose mercury news western power grid has close calldelivery problem could have led to blackouts throughout region stern warning issued to power generators who didnt deliver last week federal investigation urged by john woolfolk mailtojwoolfolksjmercurycom and steve johnson mailtosjohnsonsjmercurycommercury news the western power grid serving million people nearly collapsed a week ago when generators failed to deliver promised electricity a problem california officials warned wednesday is occurring with alarming frequency last thursdays close call could have knocked out power in states and parts of canada and mexico causing the regions worst outages in five years ``youre standing on the edge of a cliff when a generator fails to do what you order them to do said jim detmers vice president of grid operations at the california independent system operator ``its not just california thats at risk its the whole western united states the dire warning comes as californias energy crisis seems to be easing with not one of the predicted blackouts rolling across the state so far this summer the intricately balanced system came so close to failure last thursday that an unexpected outage at just one generator anywhere in the region could have triggered blackouts detmers said airtraffic analogy detmers likened the problem to airliners ignoring orders from the airtraffic control tower the iso controls the california grid scheduling delivery of electricity much as control towers schedule airplanes for landings ``its really no different than if a plane comes into san francisco international airport and doesnt follow the rules of the air traffic controller detmers said ``we had a near miss on our system you had two planes getting very close although the iso has seen similar problems as far back as december last weeks event prompted grid managers to fire a stern warning late wednesday to californias power generators and to call for federal regulators to investigate the warning cited ``a growing pattern among market participants of ``untenable acts that include ``failure to comply with dispatch instructions ``such system performance threatens the reliability of the western interconnection and cannot be tolerated the iso report said steve maviglio spokesman for gov gray davis said he hadnt been notified of the grid managers concerns but after being read language in the report said it was ``pretty strong stuff coming from the iso jan smutnyjones a former iso official who heads the independent energy producers association which represents generators said he was unaware of the reported problems but agreed the matter is a serious one ``the issue that the iso is identifying here i cant recall ever seeing that before smutnyjones said adding that it is crucial to ``get to the bottom of what the problem is and fix it quick ``system reliability is important to everybody he said companies not named grid officials would not name the companies involved or say whether they believe the problems resulted from confusion or attempts to manipulate the system to boost market prices the offenders were reported to federal regulators who will make that call detmers said smutnyjones said the problem may stem from lingering confusion among energy sellers over the federal energy regulatory commissions june order extending price controls throughout the west ``i dont think anybody is deliberately trying to put the system in jeopardy smutnyjones said ``there is some confusion and some controversy around grid managers cited two recent examples of problems that are threatening the stability of the system in one case a generator scheduled far more power than it was capable of delivering and fell more than megawatts short a megawatt is enough to power some homes or more in another case a generator balked at an iso order to deliver power needed to stabilize the system because electricity must be used as it is produced the grid manager must precisely match power supply with demand throughout the day a mismatch can trigger circuit breakers throughout the system causing widespread blackouts the last major failure on the western grid was on july when a tree growing too close to a highvoltage line in idaho sparked outages across the region affecting million customers managers goal grid managers aim to keep the system running at a frequency of hertz it normally fluctuates between and hertz detmers said last thursday it fell to hertz blackouts can begin when it gets down to hertz he said every loss of megawatts costs the system hertz he said a substantial drop in frequency can cause widespread outages that can take days to fix he said to maintain balance the iso must keep supply and demand within megawatts detmers said last thursday the system slipped more than megawatts out of balance for more than minutes and was as much as megawatts off contact john woolfolk at jwoolfolksjmercurycom mailtojwoolfolksjmercurycom or embedded picture metafileembedded picture metafile

bill_williams_iii ::::::>>>>>> fw state energy advisors fired over conflicts ethics the consultants were involved in buying electricity for california from a generator whose stock they owned setting up a clash of official duties personal interests names of the people fired disclosed below state energy advisors fired over conflicts ethics the consultants were involved in buying electricity for california from a generator whose stock they owned setting up a clash of official duties personal interestsjeffrey l rabin daryl kelley rich connelltimes staff writerslos angeles timeshome editionacopyright the times mirror companythe davis administration stung by charges of excessive secrecy disclosed late friday that it has fired five energy consultants because of conflicts of interest involving their official duties and personal finances a sixth consultant hired to help california purchase electricity has quit according to state recordsall were involved in purchasing electricity for the state from a generator whose stock they owned in addition the top lawyer for the agency buying the power was removed from her position because of concern about the way the issue of potential conflicts was handled top advisors to gov gray davis told the times that they learned of the conflicts in the last week after belatedly asking the consultants to file required economic disclosure statements a review of those documents which included stock holdings showed that some of the consultants may have crossed the line said the governors senior advisor nancy mcfadden state law prohibits officials from participating in decisions involving their personal financial interests although portraying himself as seriously concerned that such conflicts could undermine public confidence the governor has not required some of his most influential privatesector advisors to file the kind of disclosure statements that led to the firings among them are two wall street veterans who have been most influential in promoting the governors energy rescue plan which includes the largest state bond sale in us history the new york firms that employ executives joseph fichera and michael hoffman have been paid a month to among other things help pitch the billion bond issue to wall street analysts and state lawmakers the companies stand to make an additional million if the state goes through with the purchase of utility transmission lines davis contends that fichera hoffman and their associates fall into a separate category of advisor beyond the reach of the states political reform laws critics question the distinction the governors approach may be convenient for him said jim knox executive director of the watchdog group california common cause but it ignores the law disclosure is crucial because the public needs to know that decisions are not being made by people who have a conflict of interest knox said trying to evade the law with a creative use of semantics is not what they ought to be doing the firings disclosed friday are unlikely to diminish criticism surrounding the more than consultants and advisors hastily hired by the administration as it rushed into the power trading business this year more than million is being spent by the state on consultants according to state records in the process seemingly little attention was paid to routine government ethics laws it took six months for state officials to direct the consultants to file even basic disclosures of their personal finances including investments the state political reform act normally requires such forms to be filed publicly within days of starting work for state agencies even with the hastily ordered disclosures made public thus far the circumstances of most of the stock transactions remain a mystery because key information was omitted most of the consultants for example failed to state when they bought the energy stocks one of those pressing hardest for an investigation of possible conflict of interest violations and insider trading is secretary of state bill jones a republican who hopes to challenge davis next year jones has accused the governor of a conscious policy of secrecy in enforcing compliance with public disclosure laws this week jones called for a federal securities and exchange commission probe of stock purchases by state energy consultants traders owned shares of calpine the four traders removed this week all owned shares of calpine corp a san josebased power generator that has landed the largest share of the billion in longterm state power contracts their investments ranged from several thousand dollars to more than records show while working for the state department of water resources officials said they bought undetermined amounts of calpine power on the states behalf more than million worth of electricity was purchased from the state by calpine in the first quarter of this year according to the most recent records available we did not want them making governmental decisions and holding these stocks the governors legal affairs secretary barry goode said in an interview the highestranking consultant removed richard ferreira was hired on a contract in january to assist in obtaining bids for longterm power and negotiating contracts records show a former assistant general manager with the sacramento municipal utility district ferreira was paid an hour by the state after he disclosed owning as much as in calpine stock officials discovered he had participated in a review of one of the companys contracts ferreira could not be reached for comment the governors office identified the other four as traders william f mead herman leung constantine louie and peggy cheng most of whom could not be reached friday by the times all of them formerly worked as energy schedulers at the power exchange a nowdefunct energy market similar to a stock exchange created in the early days of californias electricity deregulation hired by the state in february and march the four signed temporary contracts calling for maximum payments of between and a month including living expenses in sacramento and flights home to southern california mead a former edison engineer said state officials never warned him that owning energy stock was a problem until they demanded that he sell the stock a week ago he said he bought nearly all of his shares years ago for and saw its value skyrocket as the stock split three times doubling in value each time mead said he was called by the head of the states energy buying team thursday and fired i asked very directly is this because of the stock and they wouldnt give me an answer mead said he just said your services are terminated i came up here away from home living in a hotel room trying to keep the lights on trying to get the state through a crisis and now i get a finger pointed at me as if im some sort of criminal i guess its just politics and were the pawns administration officials said they also are examining the actions of other traders including one who bought calpine stock just before beginning work for the state that trader elaine griffin who also came from the power exchange left the state power buying operation july three days after disclosing her energy industry investment griffin who the governors office said had obtained another job could not be reached for comment griffin reported purchasing to of calpine stock on feb in her final days working at the electricity exchange a few days later calpine signed and announced a billion year deal to sell power to the department of water resources on feb griffin joined the state power buying agency just as the state and calpine were finalizing an additional billion in power contracts one of those a year deal signed feb was the longest the state has awarded calpine about billion in contracts to supply power for up to years in addition to the state consultants who bought calpine stock two others reported owning stock in texasbased power marketing giant enron corp and two more bought stock in southern california edison the faltering utility that davis has committed himself to saving from bankruptcy another consultant bought stock in reliant energy of houston a large power plant operator that bought several california plants from utilities after deregulation bernard barretto an energy trader who buys energy on the daily spot market said in an interview that he bought about in enron stock shortly before he began work for the state feb purchase of enron stock defended i dont see a conflict he said at the time we werent really dealing with enron i still havent bought from enron barretto said he never considered his enron ownership a possible conflict until he received notice july that he had to sell the stocks by noon or lose his job that notice came from goode the governors lawyer we expect and have always expected the states consultants to uphold the highest ethical standards he wrote that standard is not met by those who hold a financial interest in one or more energy companies while trading on behalf of the state on energy related matters therefore each consultant who holds an interest in an energy company must divest himself or herself of that interest by noon today if he or she refuses the state will sever its contract with that person however the governors office has taken a distinctly different stance with his closest financial advisors fichera and hoffman davis aides cite an opinion sought last week from attorney raquelle de la rocha a former member of the los angeles ethics commission and the state fair political practices commission she concluded that the advisors do not have to file disclosure statements because they are contractors not consultants and will be working for less than a year on a limited range of projects fichera is davis point man on the governors energy rescue planincluding the unprecedented bond sale he has pitched the plan to lawmakers reporters and the wall street financial community fichera refused to comment on the record fichera and hoffmans companies saber partners and blackstone group prepared a controversial analysis that helped underpin legislative approval of the bond measure intended to pay for past and future power buying pact specifies financial advice the states contract with the fichera and hoffman firms calls for them to provide financial advisory services to the state the decision not to require public disclosure of their financial holdings stands in sharp contrast to the approach taken with montague derose and associates that consulting firm was hired on a million contract like the other two firms it too was hired to provide financial advisory services to the state that firms top advisor douglas s montague was required by the administration to fill out a disclosure statement he reported no power company interests the governors legal advisors said the difference is that montague is on a longer contractphoto barry goode above governors legal affairs secretary copyright dow jones company inc all rights reserved

arbitrarily in its most recent order because it has disregardedwithout explanationits earlier rulings in this case its no slam dunk but its the best argument we have we will never win an argument in any court that ferc could have or should have crafted its order a certain way a court will almost always say the agency can fix the energy crisis in any way it deems fit however courts take a dim view of inconsistent agency decisions because it demonstrates a lack of constitutional due processas for the publics opinion of enron as a profiteerfor better or worse its already established and no matter what action we take davis will cast a negative spin on it so why not fight for our interests the stakes in this order are worth it this recent order sets a bad precedent for the future viability of our business model power marketing its hard to run a business when the government can reach back in time and recalculate your selling price with complete disregard of your costs the generators get to offset refunds with input costs we should be able to use our purchased power costs i dont see much downside for us to argue that ferc should keep its word that refunds can only be ordered within days and all sellers are entitled to marginal costs we are just holding the commission to its promise at a minimum the commission needs to explain why it ignored and reversed itself on its earlier

bill_williams_iii ::::::>>>>>> sempra  million profit from the west is not much to show for all of the sleeving sempra did for the isosempras trading unit generates a windfall by craig d rose staff writer july sempra energy the parent company of sdge reported a percent surge in profit to million last quarter but said yesterday it lost money on the sale of electricity under a longterm contract to california on the other hand sempra said its largest source of profits was its energy trading unit a middleman that earned million during the quarter buying and selling energy produced by others the results underscore the transformation of relatively simple utility companies into diversified energy holding companies that have learned to profit in new ways from the deregulation of electricity and the turmoil in energy markets the surprising announcement that a company lost money selling power during californias runup in electricity prices was explained by sempra as an intentional consequence of the longterm contract it signed with the state to provide power stephen baum chairman and chief executive officer of sempra said the company agreed to provide a steep discount to california during the summer months but would recoup the losses later in the year deal california sought longterm electricity purchase contracts so it could reduce its purchases in daily and nearterm power markets where prices reached record levels critics say gov gray davis rushed into longterm deals because of concerns about getting through next years election they also say the contracts will saddle customers with higher costs for years the governor has acknowledged that longterm contracts might cause consumers to pay relatively high prices for electricity in later years but he maintains it is a fair price to pay for lowering prices that were devastating the state economy michael shames executive director of the utility consumers action network in san diego said the steep discount sempra provided to the state on power this summer raised questions about the governors proposal to help san diego gas electric co clear a debt of million sdge says it is owed that money for power purchases on behalf of its customers in a media conference last month davis said the agreement would eliminate the threat of a possible balloon payment for consumers who he said might have faced the socalled balancing account debt as early as next year shames says the proposal which took the form of a memorandum of understanding or mou is costly for consumers and a bonanza for sempra he said the relatively cheap power provided by sempra this summer makes the mou sound like more of a hidden payback to sempra than a real relief plan for local ratepayers shames said he will release an analysis of the states sempra plan next week the state public utilities commission is expected to rule on the plan in august a sempra spokesman said there is no connection between discount power and the tentative agreement to clear the million debt doug kline the sempra spokesman said the power contract with the state was signed in early may and the agreement on the balancing account was reached in midjune sempra energy trading meanwhile said only percent of its million profit was earned from sales of energy in the western region which includes california the trading operation earned million in profit during the comparable period last year californias independent system operator which manages most of the state power grid and other investigators have said trading and bidding strategies were tools used by energy companies to raise prices during the california power crisis though sempra earned money on trading its wholesale power generating business lost million during the quarter baum said the discounts on electricity provided the state were the prime cause of the loss for sempra energy resources but added that a plant outage also contributed sempra energy resources which coowns a generating plant near las vegas with reliant energy earned million during the second quarter last year baum added that sempras longterm contract with the state under which it will provide up to megawatts has allowed its wholesale business to presell about half the power it expects to generate from the nevada plant which will be expanded and three generating facilities it expects to build profits at sdge slipped to million during the quarter ended june down from million last year according to sempra sdge whose business is restricted to delivering gas and electricity said it provided increased customer service during the crisis which lowered profits wall street analysts generally applauded sempras results noting that the company was ahead of its plan to generate at least a third of its profits from its newer businesses by theyre really two years ahead of schedule for their nonutility businesses said brian youngberg an analyst with edward jones co bud leedom a san diegobased analyst with wells fargo van kasper said sempras move into energy trading now seems shrewd we never dreamed they were setting themselves for a windfall like this leedom said investors pushed sempra

bill_williams_iii ::::::>>>>>> duke other generators continue to bid into the iso above the cap federal caps didnt deter higher pricespower caliso study says suppliers continued to charge as much as five times more than the imposed limitsby nancy vogeltimes staff writerjuly sacramento after federal regulators limited wholesale electricity prices last month big private sellers of power in california continued to ask as much as five times more for electricity than the federal cap according to a confidential study by state grid operatorsthe analysis by the california independent system operator covers only the first week after the caps were imposed june caliso has submitted the data to federal regulators for potential investigation the report is a summary of what caliso calls possible anticompetitive behavior by duke energy williams cos mirant corp reliant energy and dynegy corpin a truly competitive market we would expect these suppliers to bid very close to their actual operating cost said greg cook senior policy analyst with calisos department of market analysis the state did not necessarily purchase any power at the high prices being demanded instead the significance of the bids is that they show how california could find itself paying exorbitant prices for electricity again if hot weather returns and conservation slackens said frank wolak a stanford university economist who studies the california electricity marketthe bottom line is that the generators are putting out these bids in expectation of high demand he said if weather all of a sudden gets really hot from southern to northern california the bids submitted by generators could be very costly to californiacaliso calculated the cost of production for each company based on the efficiency of its power plants and estimates of what each paid for natural gas to fuel the plantsthe average cost for the five was per megawatthour which closely matches the federal price limit in california which now stands at per megawatthour according to the power bidding procedures companies that bid at or below their cost of production often still get paid a higher price allowing them to make a substantial profiton average four of the five companies submitted bids either slightly below or slightly above their cost of production but with the exception of atlantabased mirant each company at times submitted bids that were substantially higher houstonbased reliant for example bid as much as per megawatthour more than five times its estimated cost overall reliants average bid was close to costs according to the analysiscaliso identified companies by code in its report sources familiar with the study identified the companies for the timesthe caliso report singled out supplier identified by sources as charlotte ncbased duke energy saying the company continues to bid significantly in excess of its operating costsduke owns two large power plants on the central coast it marked up its bids an average of beyond its cost to produce electricity according to the analysis for example it cost duke to to generate a megawatthour of electricity in the time period studied the report shows but the company offered to sell a megawatthour from to duke spokesman tom williams on thursday said the use of the data in some cases doesnt appear to add up and in all cases appears to be selective and could easily be misunderstood duke sells nearly the entire output of its power plants under longterm contracts and not on the spot market which the caliso report studied he notedreliant spokesman richard wheatley said were looking at the data and we question whether or not it is correcta combination of cool weather heavy conservation the startup of new power plants and recently signed longterm power contracts that guarantee supplies have eased the states electricity crisis in recent weeksmarket prices that as recently as may averaged per megawatthour have dropped to less than per megawatthourthe more abundant power supplies have freed grid operators to ignore higherpriced bids but they will have to consider paying such prices to avoid blackouts if supplies tighten wolak saidsuch a scenario would test the effectiveness of the federal energy regulatory commission order issued june he saidthe bids of the five companies analyzed were offers of sales to caliso a folsombased agency that manages the electrical transmission grid serving of california caliso buys power on short notice to smooth the flow on the states electrical freeway and avert blackoutsas californias fledgling market began to go haywire last fall caliso workers struggled to purchase as much as of the states power demand with just hours to spare since then the market has stabilized and calisos purchases now amount to roughly of the electricity california consumesrelated storypower profits power plant operator calpine said its quarterly profit more than doubled c copyright los

bill_williams_iii ::::::>>>>>> re continuing testing of preschedule workspace path confirmation and path cut software carafirst of all thanks for your input regarding the new issues with path confirmation most of these are simple problems that we can fix easily vish is already working on them concerning the colors there are three sets of colors representing market supply and transmission i have asked vish to add a color key that allows you to change the colors to your liking this information will be saved are remembered the next time you run the applicationregarding preschedule adding print capability to the error log should be no problem also adding check for errors functionality will be done concerning capability not supported deal has multiple delivery points i believe this is raised when there are multiple strips either term or schedule for a deal but the strips have different delivery points the routing process is not able to determine which strips to use i will confirm thiswe have already changed path confirmation so that it will display the longer description of the counterparty name i may have both the code and description displayed i believe corry expects to see the common name in the path confirm records corry can you confirm thisthe information you have given us will keep us busy for a couple of days but if you have more please send itthankswill original messagefrom semperger cara sent friday july pmto atta asem smith willcc bentley corry poston david williams iii billsubject continuing testing of preschedule workspace path confirmation and path cut softwarei am working in the target date of june th today i added schedules from palo verde and the entire midc sheet to the testing group once cob is added we will have pretty much an average daily volumehere is my attached worksheet for mid c file midcjunepsc in preschedule workspacei added palo verde to the group of deals imported and ran a total of lines into the path confirmation the rest of the sheet was all bookouts and so i marked them for routing only i do like the feature of being able to exlude the majority of deals from the path confirmation this will make the app much faster and less cumbersome for real time and settlementsi would like the option of printing the error sheet when it comes up as the lists can be long and i have to make notes on what is wrong also being able to check for errors before running the sheet would save us lots of time we currently have a function that checks that all names are recognized before the sheet is imported to paths this would give us the opportunity of correction before running the sheet instead of cleaning up afterwardsrouting functionality question if we change a delivery point in scheduling bpa nw delivered gets moved and changed every day do these changes not route because the deal entry strip has the original delivery point these types of deals route now i would like to duplicate that existing functionality i did get an error message on those lines capability not supported deal has multiple delivery points please see the attached sheet there is a batch of them line thru but it is all deals that are our bpa northwest deliveredthe routing speed is excellent one second per line or less all the way in portland on local enpower the megawatts also appear to split properly between mismatched deal amounts this is very encouraging my palo data was corrupted so my primary focus for checking routing will be the other delivery pointsmy plan is to attack the alias stuff from a different angle we are going to work with the team that sets the enpower short name to something that is workable i would like to make a new path of approval where the schedulers help set that enpower short name in path confirmationthe early sorting looks good things look very versatile and useable yesterday i identified several problems the entire path needs to be shown in both counterparty paths currently only the upstream or downstream shows depending on if you are looking at the supply cp or the market cp the alias list is not functioning properly the enpower long name needs to be shown in the collapsed counterparty view along with the phone number and a check box to indicate if we check out with the cp confirming the deals needs to be done as a batch not pulling up each deal line by linetoday i am finding the following when a path is pulled up from the line view to the expanded view the system blows away the schedule term and the delivery point these fields have to be repopulated before saving can occuri am not allowed to sort by global id even though global ids are populated there my idea is that if there is a global present it goes in one section no globals go in another section and then expaning on the global section gets the individual numbers just like the phys vs non phys pulling up an individual path from line view to expanded view takes over minutes this is to long to be practical in production for real time i would like to see this time go to seconds or less all paths are showing up as being cut cut checkbox checked even though none have been cut yet the grey on grey color scheme is not going to work but that is a little thing lighter colors for the back ground are going to be preferable variations of the beige color are easier to read the path cut button and dialog boxes i think are going to need alot of work it looks like i will have to do all the enpower work first and then populate the cut this is a bit different than we discussed my plan is to take this as far as i can and then hand it over to bill williams iii and his group for final tweaking i also cannot sort by tag number we need thatthank you all for your work on this it is really looking good i have to schedule on

undisclosedrecipientsenronsubject power pointsgenerators heres to better luck in brazil new york dow jonesless than a month after the federal energy regulatory commission shot the messenger its looking for new volunteers on june the ferc totally trashed us wholesale electricity markets with price controls and an order for refunds dating back to october or to may or to whenever they later decide what is the ferc price cap on electricity throughout the western us well its whatever the california independent system operator decides it is nevertheless on wednesday the ferc made a sharp uturn in the direction of free markets for power with unquestioning confidence it ordered all us utilities to consolidate their transmission lines into a few independent transmission operators in order to foster free trade and movement of electricity surely some might say the ferc didnt give the california iso total price discretion over the western us did it after all the iso is simply the administrator of the fercs very precise formulas like this one for nonemergencies the cost of burning natural gas assuming a power plant is located both in northern california and southern california at the least efficient generator that was called on in the most expensive hour of the most recent stage emergency that wasnt a stage at any point during the hour plus for operation and maintenance multiplied by then add if the buyer is the california department of water resources what could be more clear more marketbased as the ferc trumpeted its own ingenuity how could the iso possibly manipulate that the isos initial cap of a megawatthour was based on a gas price of after inputting the other elements that cap turns out to be based on a quite efficient heat rate of surely the heat rate of the least efficient unit used in the most recent emergency etc was or higher but the iso decided it didnt want to pay more than mwh who confirms that the iso really used the correct heat rate nobody now after gas prices crashed to the iso had full discretion based on a technicality to avoid resetting the cap at all four opportunities the iso declined to reset the cap because the iso staff know they cant get the power california needs for which is where the cap would have come out using the old heat rate thats way below the costs of the marginal generators needed when things get even a little tight sierra pacific resources srp nevada power couldnt get all the power it needed july for even so what is the ferc price cap on western power whatever the california iso says it is not surprisingly nevada power and others western utilities are furious with california for successfully using its political muscle to export its problem to the rest of the west before the ferc price caps the market definitely was working when you had prices of a megawatthour people were mortgaging their restaurants to buy a diesel generator to sell power into the grid said chelan county public utility districts chuck berrie one of a handful of utility veterans in the us who thrived in the deregulated wholesale market unlike those of most other western utilities chelans customers havent seen a rate increase and wont for the next five years because berrie and his coworkers have maximized the utilitys assets and market opportunities people were coming out of the woodwork to get generators on line ive never seen anything like it but the ferc order killed them berrie said orders for hundreds of small dieselfired generators that could have helped get the west through the next months or so were canceled immediately after the ferc order because the generators cost more than mwh to operate they are expensive to run but could have patched over the shortage until big permanent power plants are finished in but who wanted to bet in late june that the california iso would pass up the opportunity for a price cap so the orders were canceled in fact even with the cap stuck at at least megawatts of installed generators are being taken off line and sent back to the rental companies when the blackouts come hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses will be without power that the generators could have provided the biggest manufacturer of such generators caterpillar inc cat said it is redirecting the units to brazil which like the western us is highly dependent on hydroelectricity and brazil like the west is enduring a drought this year brazil however isnt under ferc jurisdiction but surely the generators must not be needed if we are sending them down to poor old brazil not so according to utility employees like berrie as well as the quasigovernmental northwest power planning council the chances of blackouts this summer and winter is still much higher than acceptable and of course higher still without those temporary generators price controls kill the messenger high prices say that supply should be increased and usage reduced really high prices like those the west has endured for the past year say hurry but the administration of george w bush after getting a good ol political whuppin at the hands of california gov gray davis agreed to shoot the messenger why would anybody get into this industry with all the uncertainty of this ridiculousness its the price caps as well as the rebates or youre going to get sued regular people were practically turning over their couches to get the nickels together to invest in a generator and they have lost their investment berrie says i think the horse is dead even if you removed the regulations and prices did come back up people still wont come back what certainty would you have that they wont change the rules again who can take that risk he added yet the ferc just ordered the restructuring of many billions of dollars of transmission lines as the foundation of a free market in the east they must be wondering what that messenger said before the ferc shot him apparently it was brazils economy can afford to pay more

bill_williams_iii ::::::>>>>>> summary judges recommendation re retroactive refunds commenting on his general perception of the settlement conference the chie f judge in his down home manner did not miss the opportunity to say that you can take a horse to water but you cant make him drink below is a c liff notes version of the judges report and recommendation issued at pm today attached is the complete work the judge opined that very large refunds would be due while the amount of such refunds is not billion as claimed by the state of california th ey do amount to hundreds of millions of dollars probably more than a billi on dollars in an aggregate sum at the same time while there are vast su ms due for overcharges there are even larger amounts owed to energy seller s by the caiso the investor owned utilities and the state of california can a cash refund be required where a much larger amount is due the seller the chief judge thinks not another notable quote it is the opinio n of the chief judge that the amount claimed by the state of california has not and cannot be substantiated the judge noted that he submitted a proposal of his own on july which wa s summarily rejected by the state of california and that the five separate offers of the various industry groups to settle with california were also rejected refund effective date refund effective date of october for sales in the spot markets of the caiso and the cal px the chief judges recomme ndations do not go beyond that date spot market sales are sales that a re hours or less and that are entered into the day of or day prior to de livery evidentiary hearing the differences between what the state of california believes the buyers in the california markets are owed in refunds and what the sellers in the california market believe should be refunded raise mater ial issues of fact the appropriate numbers to calculate potential refunds involve factual disputes thus the chief judge recommends that a trialty pe evidentiary hearing be ordered limited to a factual record to apply to the methodology set forth below because of the urgent need for an answer to the refund issues that hearing should be on a day fast track schedule it is important that a single methodology be adopted for calculating pot ential refunds in this proceeding however such a methodology may not be appropriate for all sellers in the caisos and cal pxs spot markets in an afterthefact refund calculation in any event sellers not using the m ethodology should bear the burden of demonstrating that their costs exceede d the results of the methodology recommended herein over the entire refund period methodology the chief judge recommends that the methodology set forth in t he june th order be used with the modifications discussed below in order to calculate any potential refunds that may be due to customers in the cais os and cal pxs spot energy and ancillary service markets for the period o ctober through may heat rate the actual heat rates rather than hypothetical heat rates asso ciated with recreating the mustbid requirement of the june th order pro vide the first step in calculating the cost of the marginal unit gas cost the gas costs associated with the marginal unit should be based upon a daily spot gas price in the event that the marginal unit is locat ed in np north of path the daily spot gas price for pge citygate a nd malin should be averaged with the resulting gas price multiplied by the marginal units heat rate to calculate a clearing price for that hour if the marginal unit is located in sp south of path the daily spot gas price for southern california gas large packages should be multiplied by t he marginal units heat rate to calculate a clearing price for that hour the daily spot gas prices should be for the midpoint as published in fina ncial times energys gas daily publication for the aforementioned deliver y points the last published gas prices should be used in calculating the refund price for the days that gas daily is not published weekends and hol idays om adder an adder of mwh for om should also be included with the cal culated market clearing price emissions costs demonstrable emission costs should be excluded from the ma rket clearing price and treated as an additional expense that sellers may s ubtract from their respective refund calculation credit adder the percent adder should be included in the market clearin g price for all transactions that occurred after january when pge and socal edison were deemed no longer creditworthy ancillary services consistent with the june th order ancillary service prices would be capped at the market clearing price established in the rea ltime imbalance energy market adjustment bids would also be treated the same as set forth in the june th order maximum price for nonemergency hours somewhat unclear the chief judge r ecommends that for purposes of recreating a competitive market for calculat ing refunds the refund methodology should deviate from the nonemergen cy requirement of the june th order to measure the amount that actual p rices may have exceeded the refund price every hour should be recalculated offsets recalculating the hourly competitive price for purposes of a ref und calculation would also permit the cal px and caiso to resettle all char ges for the refund period amounts owed to sellers and outstanding amounts due from buyers would be recalculated any refunds could then be offset a gainst accurate amounts receivable without sellers netting out any of their purchases from the caiso and cal px during the refund period interest interest should not be charged against any refund amounts unless the refund amount exceeds the amounts that are past due to the seller

bill_williams_iii ::::::>>>>>> stranger hi there strangerwell i havent spoken to you or heard from you in a few days and im justcheckin to see that my lil buddy in portland isnt working himself toohard as you know i tried to call you tonight but then had to leave for aworkout and a scrimmage soccer game i am so sore its out of controlok so down to the real reason im writing brendan and i had a great timeat happy hour we talked a little about you but mostly about life ingeneral he had mentioned that he had emailed me so i rushed home to checkitbasically he said all good things but there was one thing that struck me asodd i guess because he also brought the same point up at the restraunthe had written that although you thought i was cool and whatever you hadcommented on how strange the situation was and he sort of elaborated onthatso the point of this email is i guess to reassure you that i only have thebest intentions towards you i am not trying to be your girlfriend oranything similar to that to tell you the truth i dont even know what yourromantic situation is i just think you are an awesome guy whom id loveto become close friends with i am ecstatic that you are coming to visit me in huntington beach if youstill are and im thrilled that we can go sight seeing touring together ibragged and bragged to brendan about what a great guy you were and then camehome to feel like maybe you were taken back by my advances i really amjust a very overly affectionate and loving person not to mentionspontaneous i didnt mean to scare you away from having a greatfriendship with me and me with youfor heavens sake you are my portland connection and im your beach bumbuddy honestly if i were a psycho i would have jumped at the chance tocome up and see your condo when you offered i just think you are someoneid love to get to know especially if you are anything like brendan whichbest friends usually are he is such a sweetie when he and meg go to visither mom in la they might just stop over for a visit and of course they arewelcome to stay with me as welli guess i never asked if you had a girlfriend or someone in your life and tobe quite honest i didnt even think to ask brendan because its notimportant i want you bill for your friendship and for your companionshipnow and when i move to portland reflecting back i realize that i may havewritten or said something that caught you off guard its just mypersonality im a huge flirt for heavens sake i was voted mostflirtatious my senior year not to mention most likely to succeedprobably the second one due to the first but who knows hahaha im onlyteasingok seriously now bill i want you to be honest if i did locating yourcondo etc or said like that was the most romantic thing i had ever readthat was written by a guy something to upset you or give you a falseimpression i am so sorry i do find you attractive and perhaps if we livedin the same town or had met a little differently or for that matter i knewyour romantic stiuation yeah i would have jumped at the chance to havedated you but we didnt and the truth is i can never have too manyfriends especially good looking ones that i can introduce to all my girlfriends so that they can be jealous with envy like i said i only have the best of intentions towards you and towrds ourrelationship as friends but if you are uncomfortable with something ivedone or said i am so very sorry and all you have to do is tell me or emailme and youll never hear from me again scouts honor i ve never been ascout but im not know for my lies either teeheei would love to hear any concerns that you might have in regards to ourrealtionship as friends if i can ill put your mind at ease if not well ienjoyed our short minute interlude as always you are still welcome tocome

datedor had much of a wild stage and i have told him that we will see otherpeople hes fine with that as wellok i admit that his potland stunt was a little irrational but hey i thoughtit was thoughtful and darling i love surprises and little extras ijust didnt expect to have made plans and make myself look like the bad guyto someone whom id never met therefore i did everything in my power torectify the situation and make both sides happy and in doing so caused thisyou think im a psycho not to mention i had to face brendan and before hecould read my email you had already revealed the stroy to him

bill_williams_iii ::::::>>>>>> duke plant employees turn out to be disgruntled misinformed employees with an ax to grind these guys filed a bunch of complaints against sempra too back when sempra owned the plantschdukes calif whistleblowers have history of grievances updated wednesday june pm et by jason leopold of dow jones newswires los angeles dow jonesthree former employees who last week told california lawmakers duke energy duk investmentsquotessymbolduk news investmentsnewssymbolduk msgs investmentsdiscusssymbolduk ramped down its south bay power plant when supplies were tight filed a total of complaints while they were still working at the plant including allegations of harassment and racial discrimination the men told dow jones newswires most of the grievances were filed between and against the plants previous owner sempra energy sre investmentsquotessymbolsre news investmentsnewssymbolsre msgs investmentsdiscusssymbolsre unit san diego gas electric for which the men continued to work while duke controlled the plant but interviews with the three men also revealed a dissatisfaction with dukes profitcentered management style in the deregulated market duke has called the employees allegations about its operating procedures baseless duke has said the employees have an ax to grind because they werent hired by the company in april when escrow on the power plant closed and duke acquired some of sdges workforce the men are the first to come forward publicly and testify against their employers who are locked in a highstakes struggle with the state of california over allegations of price gouging the state is pursuing billions of dollars in refunds from power producers and hopes to bring criminal charges against their executives glenn johnson a mechanic at the south bay power plant alone filed complaints on one occasion johnson said he called the california division of occupational safety and health because an unqualified employee was found scraping up asbestos he also has a harassment complaint against sdge regarding an employee who now works for duke but johnson said his lawyer told him not to discuss it aside from the formal complaints johnson said under the duke regime he was disciplined for taking too much sick time after being out for months for cancer treatment this is just the kind of abuse we had to endure ever since this became a business he said one of the other employees jim olkjer a former assistant control room operator at the power plant filed three complaints against sdge while duke operated the plant because his evaluations consistently said he needed supervision the grievances were either turned down or settled he said olkjer said he decided to testify against duke after he learned he wouldnt be hired by the energy company when it took over plant operations in april im on a fixed income now olkjer said in an interview i cant afford my utility bills on a fixed income the third employee ed edwards a certified power plant mechanic said he filed one complaint against three sdge employees in for racial discrimination one of the employees was hired by duke that case is still pending edwards an africanamerican said duke didnt hire qualified minority employees after it took over the plant and instead hired lessqualified white employees edwards said the two minority supervisors that worked at the plant under sdge were replaced with white employees when duke took over edwards who stopped working at the plant in february said he decided to testify against duke after receiving a phone call from johnson i knew i wouldnt be hired he said edwards and johnson filed charges of harassment and racial discrimination against sdge with the us equal employment opportunity commission sdge spokesman art larson wouldnt comment on the allegations duke spokesman tom williams said the company stands by its hiring practices and always hires the most qualified employees in duke settled a discrimination claim with the us department of labor for in which the department found some areas where white females and black males were paid less than white male and black female counterparts in similar positions dissatisfaction with new priorities the former employees said they werent motivated to blow the whistle on duke by the prospects of cashing in on a possible settlement with the state johnson first alerted the media about dukes behavior before state attorney general bill lockyer mentioned financial rewards for whistleblowers the employees each earned about a week all three employees said they believe duke mismanaged the south bay power plant by ramping the units up and down tossing out spare parts and operating machinery when it was broken olkjer said he saw the plants output reduced during the worst power emergencies at least times when edwards questioned his supervisors about the behavior he said they told him its none of your business the employees said that duke was more concerned with making money than the happiness of its staff and that the company tried to bust its union contract when it first took over the plant i was paid to twist wrenches johnson said the last raise i got two years ago was thats an insult to my skill duke said it is bringing the former sdge employees under its contract with international brotherhood of electrical workers local the workers were previously represented by another local and duke wanted a single contract johnson said he decided to blow the whistle on duke because he was disgusted by the companys gluttony and greed he said he stole the control room logs in february after a colleague pointed out to him that duke was reducing output at the plant johnson edwards and olkjer said in the old days the power plant ran at full throttle and never ramped up or down but as soon as deregulation became law in the state things started to change sdge would also vary the plants output but not as dramatically as duke did they said to the best of my recollection we had years of being extremely reliable and being on line all the time edwards said once duke took the reins that changed we were no longer a family duke has said that it adjusted the plants output to meet its contractual commitments and to respond to the directions of the california independent system operator manager of the states power grid the iso frequently directed plants to ramp output up and down to meet changing requirements on the grid and the employees who testified werent in a position to know the whole picture said bill hall vice president of dukes western operations duke spokesman tom williams said the company plans to release data showing the iso ordered the plant to ramp up and down jan the period cited from the controlroom logs to keep supply in balance a copy of the iso controlroom logs obtained by dow jones newswires shows that the iso did make such orders during a stage emergency because it didnt need dukes capacity which it thought too expensive by jason leopold dow jones newswires jasonleopolddowjonescom mailtojasonleopolddowjonescom embedded picture metafile

bill_williams_iii ::::::>>>>>> deal confirmation changes good afternoon ronwe just had a meeting with bill williams head of realtime trading in portland to discuss some problems we are having with the realtime deals flowing to the deal confirmation system currently the deal confirmation system is pulling the term information so that changes made by realtime to reflect actual volumetric flow price are not seen by the confirmation groups one possible solution has already been examined and that would be to have the realtime traders use deal entry to make all the changes this solution will not work if the realtime guys start changing the deals in deal entry the original negotiated deal will be lost also and more importantly the time to make all the changes for the realtime adjustments in deal entry would make it impossible to keep up with the high volume of deals we are now seeingthanks david postonit manager portland

energy regulatory commission first street newashington dc dear chairman hbertsince last summer the committee on energy and commerce has closelymonitored the electricity situation in california today the westcontinues to suffer from the second worst drought in a century andcalifornia faces the threat of blackouts and potential price spikes againthis summer after extensive review of the energy crisis in the westincluding several hearings in washington and california we recommend thatthe commission take further actions to help mitigate wholesale electricityprices and keep power flowing into californiawe recognize the commissions efforts in recent months to address theelectricity crisis in the california and western markets including measuresto investigate and mitigate wholesale electricity prices while we arepleased that current trends show reduced demand and lower prices throughoutthe west we remain concerned about the potential impacts of high wholesaleelectricity prices on consumers and economic growth in california and theentire west in the hot summer months to come to ensure that prices arejust and reasonable during the critical months ahead we believe thecommission can and should do more to mitigate wholesale electricity pricesin western markets we strongly urge the commission to implement acomprehensive plan to mitigate wholesale prices and aggressively monitorwholesale sales of electric energy by public utilities and other marketparticipants within the entire western systems coordinating council wsccspecifically such a plan should ensure that rates for all wholesaleelectricity sales are just and reasonable in all markets throughout thewscc the plan should also prohibit unnecessary generation outages andfailures to comply with agreements to sell power if the commission findsthat a rate charged does not comply with the price mitigation plan itshould strictly enforce the plan and require refunds and penalties to thefull extent allowed by lawaware of the danger of discouraging supply the commission has relied uponmarketoriented methods rather than imposing rigid price controls that wouldexacerbate the crisis and increase the likelihood of blackouts we sharethe commissions concerns regarding the need to encourage supplyaccordingly to prevent blackouts and contribute to a longterm solutionthe commissions comprehensive plan should adopt market mechanisms asappropriate and allow recovery of all verifiable costs to avoid discouragingavailability of supply and investment in new generation and transmissionto mitigate prices and increase available supply we also urge thecommission to take every additional step within its authority to promoteconservation and demand response throughout the western market in stateswhere retail rates do not fully reflect wholesale costs consumers have lessincentive to conserve while demand reduction incentives are not asubstitute for accurate price signals a demand response program canencourage conservation while retail and wholesale rates are not in paritysuch a program should provide incentives and opportunities for bothwholesale and retail consumers to sell at market or other incentive pricesforegone electric load that they would otherwise be expected to consumespecifically the commission should establish or certify a wholesaleclearinghouse for demand reduction agreements and enable consumerswhether individually or through aggregation arrangements to sell foregonepower to their own local distribution utility or to thirdparty purchaserswe recognize that individual states and utilities are implementing demandreduction programs but a broader regional solution is needed to enablesufficient demand reductions in time for an expected hot summer weunderstand that such a program can be implemented without preempting statelaws abrogating existing contracts or shifting costs to nonparticipantconsumerswe look forward to working with you to build upon the commissions previousefforts to ensure reliable power supplies at just and reasonable prices forconsumers in california and the west this summer and thereafter to

online this new companywide portal under the leadership of tony mends will be launched in several phases beginning this fall another significant area where we can be more diligent in our spending is travel and entertainment enron has long had travel policies in place as we have grown we have not done as well as we should have in communicating those policies to new employees and reminding all employees to take advantage of the discounts we have negotiated the availability of discounts and booking services online should make it easy to save money for the company without sacrificing the

have access to the significant airfare discounts negotiated by gss or httpclicktripenroncomenron the new online travel booking service that allows employees to book their own travel with the same negotiated discounts employees who fly in the united states should book nonrefundable coach tickets which are typically percent less than refundable tickets and can usually be changed by simply paying a fee for this reason we strongly encourage all employees to purchase nonrefundable domestic coach tickets when possible lodging gss has also negotiated preferred rates at a number of hotel chains in many cities worldwide to accommodate each business units individual hotel policy we recommend that you use enrons list of preferred hotels to select accommodations that are in line with your business

reached at because there are differences between business units and offices each business unit leader will follow up this memo with a communication further elaborating on these policies as they apply to their business uniteach of us has a responsibility to make sure we do our part to ensure enron retains its competitive edge these recommendations are some basic sensible actions we can take companywide but it is up to every employee to look for cost saving measures and do what makes sense in your daily activities if you have an idea or a suggestion you would like to share with us please

bill_williams_iii ::::::>>>>>> fw morgan stanley buys a big piece of bpas southern interie according to this article morgan stanley now controls about onethird of the southern interties total northbound capacity or about megawatts until february then its share drops to just over megawatts until march sch wall street joins the energy players by les blumenthal bee washington bureau published june washington wall streets interest in the west coast electricity crisis extends far beyond trading energy futures in some manhattan skyscraper or arranging financing for muchneeded generating plants morgan stanley which earned more than billion last year has quietly purchased a major share of one of the bonneville power administrations huge transmission lines that link california with the pacific northwest the million deal caught bonneville off guard and has sparked concern among regional utility executives and lawmakers on capitol hill morgan stanley officials said they would use their capacity on the socalled intertie to ship power purchased in the southwest for sale to utilities in washington state and oregon although most of the attention in the western power crisis has focused on major energy companies from texas and other southern states morgan stanley ranks among the largest power marketers in the nation according to reports filed with the federal energy regulatory commission morgan stanley registered as a power marketer with federal regulators in the first wall street firm to take such a step merrill lynch also is registered with the commission wall street firms have long played a role in the trading of commodities including energy said judy hitchen a morgan stanley spokeswoman in new york but many in the utility industry said they hadnt realized morgan stanley was buying and selling electricity for actual sale and not just engaging in electronic trading i wasnt aware of it mark crisson superintendent of tacoma power said of morgan stanleys purchase of capacity on the intertie it shows how things are changing and in congress rep peter defazio dore said morgan stanleys direct involvement in west coast electricity markets wasnt all that surprising its wonderfully lucrative for a few folks defazio said this is the big new game its the new world of deregulated energy bonneville has four major transmission lines linking california and the northwest capable of carrying enough electricity to power almost seven cities the size of seattle the lines were built by the federal government are operated by the transmission arm of bpa and soon may be turned over to an independent operator to quiet utility fears that bonneville could hog the regions power grid morgan stanley now controls about onethird of the lines total northbound capacity or about megawatts until february then its share drops to just over megawatts until march bpa and several other utilities own the rest of the capacity they sent us a fax telling us they wanted to buy capacity on such and such a date and ending on such and such a date said shepard buchanan a spokesman for bpas transmission side no one had ever made a longterm purchase of that transmission path before it had never come up before under federal regulation bpa had no choice but to accept the morgan stanley bid the transmission lines act like huge spigots that can be turned off and on depending on demand though federal regulations prohibit manipulating the lines for profit theoretically the company that controls the spigot has a huge say in the market buchanan said bonneville would be keeping a close watch on morgan stanley we are concerned he said we dont want anyone gaming the market by controlling the transmission system we will keep a close eye on morgan stanley and others although not a secret the deal was finalized in early january and since then has been accompanied by little public notice we purchase transmission capacity from time to time to help us meet our delivery obligations hitchen said in response to written questions morgan stanleys internet site and annual report make only passing mention of its power marketing commodity trading revenues rose percent to a record level in fiscal primarily driven by higher revenues from certain energyrelated products including electricity natural gas and crude oil the companys annual report said increases in energy prices were primarily attributable to strong demand for energy products relatively low inventory and reduced production values morgan stanley officials are quick to deny they have any intent to manipulate the market saying that though it may be required to sell any capacity on the intertie it doesnt use to other power marketers federal regulations prohibit it from making a profit on such sales we have also offered capacity for resale to third parties hitchen said others remain skeptical bonnevilles powermarketing arm also has expressed unease with the morgan stanley contract bonneville sells about percent of the wholesale electricity in the northwest most of it lowcost hydropower generated at the federal dams on the columbia and snake rivers it also controls about percent of the regions electric transmission grid crisson said he also was concerned about a possible conflict of interest because morgan stanley and other wall street firms help arrange financing for new generating plants it doesnt surprise me a lot that they are marketing power he said they are capitalists but they need to be careful because they underwrite debt equity for utilities

bill_williams_iii ::::::>>>>>> bloomberg fees please read the following carefully and retain this information for use whenever you trade on bloomberg bloomberg charges a flat broker fee this fee applies whether you are the aggressor or receiver of a trade this fee applies each time you make a trade on bloomberg ie per hit or lift regardless of volume when you extend a bloomberg deal in deal entry account for each separate trade accordingly by adding to any existing broker fee because this fee is flat select the flat button to the right of the broker fee and most importantly make a note in the broker box that the broker is in fact bloombergi know that many of you were never notified of the bloomberg fee structure but going forward we should see every trade done on bloomberg showing up in the system as having been done with bloomberg the confirms group in houston has compiled a weighty list of missing hourly trades since the advent of real time bloomberg trading i believe these are all in the system but possibly short a broker name and fee this going forward should no longer be a problemplease let me know if you have any questions regarding bloomberg trading andor fees thankskate

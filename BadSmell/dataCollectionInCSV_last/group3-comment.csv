### Useful notes for our proposal
 - Email folders do not necessarily correspond to simple semantic topics
 - They correspond to unfinished todo tasks, project groups, certain recipients, or loose agglomerations of topics.
 - Users tend to folder some messages by sender, some by event, some by date and in many cases the logic behind a certain foldering choice can be difficult to discern.
 - Email content and foldering habits differ drastically from one email user to another.
 - An email foldering system should be adaptive to the working style of individual users.

### Data source
 - Use the well-known [Enron Email Dataset](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/)
 - A smaller but foldered corpus [SRI](http://www.ai.sri.com/project/CALO). 
 - However, the link for downloading data can not be found anymore. Because the author changed his domain of his homepege. We may write email for the data.

### Method and Results
- Comparing email classification results of four classifiers (Maximum Entropy, Naive Bayes, SVM and Winnow),
- SVM performs best for most of the cases.
- Winnow classifier is computationally attractive and easy to implement, 
- Winnow classifier in many cases achieving statistically similar performance as SVM
- Evaluation: dividing a dataset into time-based data chunks and incrementally testing classi¯cation performance on each chunk while training on all the previous chunks.",175968705

### Data Source:
Enron data set

### Summary: 
The authors take a user-oriented approach to apply AI to the email classifications. The classifications focus on three tasks: summary keyword generation, email reply prediction and attachment prediction.

### Methods: 
- For the summary keyword generation, unsupervised approach based on latent concept models(LSA and LDA) of a user’s mailbox is used, because they requires no annotated training data and generates keywords that describe each message in the context of other related messages in user’s mailbox.
- For the reply prediction, the authors introduce user-specific relational features constructed from user profiles. 
- For attachment prediction, relational features generated from user profiles and additional task-specific features in emails are involved to predict the needs of attachments.

### Evaluation:

### Data source: 
Enron Email Dataset

### Methods: 
The authors transform the email dataset into a decision table using the Ant Colony Decision Forest(ACDF algorithm which is an Ensemble classifier based on the Ant Colony Decision Trees. Each splitting rule of the the decision trees is performed independently for different subset of attributes. And Bagging and Boosting strategy is used for training process. Ant Colony Optimization is a type of AI which is a form of emergent collection intelligence of groups of simple individuals.

### Evaluation: 
- The evaluations of decision trees in the training stage will be calculated using Equation(8) which is related to the tree size, and classification accuracy of that tree from training dataset. 
- The Experiment results compares AdaBoost, Bagging, Random Forest, and adaptive ACDF with aACDF giving the highest accuracy.

### Problem And Future Work:
There is no explicit discussion about the data processing or feature extraction. And the authors state in the futrure stages, the text mining elements in analysis of email content will be incorporated with the pheromne trail of ACO algorithm to produce positive effects. ",176402805

(A really great paper for our application)
### Data Source 
 - They created the datasets on their own by collecting through various web sources. No link provided.

### Motivation
 - Unprioritized mails
 - Manual organization of emails

### Current Application
 - Gmail organize mails using combination of some rules.
 - An **Email Predictor 2** plugin is already there which is a Microsoft Outlook add - on.
 - Various features are already provided.
  - There will be initial mails and tags associated with those are taken as training data.
  - After prediction, users can give an Explicit feedback and correct the tags.
  - If user made a mistake in the tag, rollback option is given.
  - If classifier is not confident then positive feedback will help in correcting those predictions

### Assumptions:
 - User spend time for longer on emails and changes the tags, so if he corrects the tag then, the remaining tags must be correct.

### Methods
 - No Implicit Feedback (NoIF) : After prediction, users can just edit/remove/add the tags. Negative prediction and positive prediction will stay with the same level of confidence for the tags.
 - Simple Implicit Feedback (SIF) : After prediction, users can just edit/remove/add the tags. Negative prediction will gain the confidence and positive prediction will gain the confidence. That it will consider all the tags as correctly.
- Implicit Feedback without SIF (IFwoSIF) : Counts number of implicit feedback events (like copying, replying, forwarding, saving an attachment, moving to a folder). When count reaches specific threshold, then training examples are immediately created.
- Implicit Feedback with SIF (IFwSIF) : If the user changes a tag, then implicit feedback examples are immediately created. Else, it continues to count up events until the number of events reach a threshold.

### Results
 - IFwSIF performs better. 

### Future Paper which can be read
 - Adaptive regularization of weight vectors
 - Confidence-Weighted Linear Classification

\subsubsection{Unsupervised Learning}
% @Amritanshu
Unsupervised learning is the machine learning task of inferring a function to describe hidden structure from unlabeled data. There are various tools of doing unsupervised learning, and we used Latent Dirichlet allocation~\cite{blei2003latent}. We used LDA because of its useful importance and advantages for finding useful topics from an unlabeled data. LDA features were extracted and given as input to SVM learner. LDA is used as a feature extractor. We have already shown in Figure 4 that SVM performs better than the other classifiers.

The Famous Enron email dataset is used and have already specified about the pre-processing steps and its final structure above. We tested the data on 7 different users. There are different labels already defined for the mails. We selected 5 top labels for each user dataset, and converted it into a binary classifier where those 5 labels are given ""YES"" label and others as ""NO"" label. And we also selected different ranges of cluster size namely 20, 50 and 100. Respective results can be seen for all the different cluster size given below.

      \caption{Performance of LDA with 12 clusters}
      \label{fig: comp among users}
    \end{figure}
    
    \begin{figure}[t]
      \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{./fig/lda_SVM_50.png}
      \caption{Performance of LDA with 50 clusters}
      \label{fig: comp incrementally}
    \end{figure}
    
    \begin{figure}[t]
      \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{./fig/lda_SVM_100.png}
      \caption{Performance of LDA with 100 clusters}
      \label{fig: comp among users}
    \end{figure}
    

Following results show highly instability of F-Score across different datasets. The reason for that is, if we have large data for positive class then it gets you good results but if number of negative labels dominant over positive labels, it performs poorly. The other problem which we saw, the instability of these clusters even if there was no changes in the data or the parameters of the algorithm. These results made us to not use unsupervised features to train a classifier.

\subsection{GUI Development}
% @Amritanshu

The GUI is developed using Python Tkinter package. We took Gmail as our sample for making the Mailbox GUI. See Figure 9 for our mailbox interface.

      \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{./fig/FinalPic.png}
      \caption{Graphical User Interface}
      \label{fig: comp among users}
    \end{figure}

We have provided users with read mails, move mails to different folders, creation of user defined folders. We have also provided the user with different features to select on demand. These features are Implicit User Feedback, Explicit User Feedback, Multi-folders. 

The GUI is designed to not only load local email files for training classifier, but also read email from the online email account for different users. Under the hood, it will connect the server at preset frequency, fetch emails from the online account, categorize them using local classifier and refresh the emails saved on local folders. Currently, it support Gmail accounts only for security settings.

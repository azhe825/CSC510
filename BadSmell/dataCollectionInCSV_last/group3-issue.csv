18,Data sets ready?
19,About Supervised Classifiers
20,We need a small demo on March 1st?
21,Code to transform the pre-processed data into numeric metrics (i.e. TF as we have discussed before).
22,Merge pull request #1 from azhe825/master

24,Preprocessed Data
25,Vector too long?
26,Alternate featurization methed: word vector?
27,Let's only take 10 emails per folder as our training data set.
28,Cleaned data
29,Simple framework 
30,Word Vector performs badly when training set is only 10 emails....

13,group7/user1,1455036620,1455037627,"Here are my thoughts on the ['Clipboard Manager'](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Clipboard%20Manager) plugin.

Install isn't too bad, you have to re-register your ctrl-c/ctrl-p (or for mac cmd-c/cmd-p) commands to use the managers commands. Once you are using their copies and pastes however it performs just like normal copy and paste; however, you can choose to show your history at the bottom of the screen like so:

![screen shot 2016-02-09 at 11 47 21 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3922117/12923245/fe09324c-cf22-11e5-8266-5f4126ec303f.png)

As you can see in the screenshot it handles indents through a special backslash, so while you can just fast copy from this box at the bottom if you want to preserve indents you must use their special commands for traversing the history and paste from that (an inconvenience). You can see where the history is currently pointed at from the big arrow on line 1.

Overall the plugin is nice but I don't like how it goes as far as to add a visual GUI component but you can only interact with it correctly through commands. This may be a larger problem with Sublime extensions on the whole though.
",181952869
13,group7/user1,1455037093,1455037644,"Here are my thoughts on the ['Clipboard History'](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Clipboard%20History) plugin.

Install is way easier, don't have to remap commands it just works with your native ctrl-c/ctrl-v (or cmd-c/cmd-v) which is nice. Basically as you copy your history is build and by using a complex command (⌘⎇⌃V on mac) you can show your history and it appears in the command box at the top like so:

![screen shot 2016-02-09 at 11 55 27 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3922117/12923564/37b4404e-cf24-11e5-882f-e7fde47a60dd.png)

From here you can simply click an item and it will show up at your cursor location. Alternatively like the other plug-in you can use commands to navigate the history so your next paste pastes from the current  index. Unlike the other plugin your history doesn't stay visible as you work so you have to enter the command to see the history, then use commands to navigate and paste which is a huge pain.",181956109
13,group7/user1,1455037590,1455037897,"Here are my thoughts on the ['Jimbly's Clipboard History'](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Jimbly's%20Clipboard%20History) plugin.

So this just seems like a more updated version of the ['Clipboard History'](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Clipboard%20History) plugin with an easier command to access the clipboard history. But seriously besides that it seems identical on the surface level:

![screen shot 2016-02-09 at 12 04 34 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3922117/12923884/74bf74e4-cf25-11e5-8058-ce40b9c8555e.png)

Its last update was 8 months ago compared to the other plugins last update 3 years ago so really it just seems like the same project with a couple more recent tweaks. Same problem as before with the history not being static.

This is probably our best bet to start working from if we choose to go down the sublime route, my immediate changes to consider making would be:
- Making the history static, in other words have the history always be an active window, right now when you perform any action the history disappears 
- Having the history show automatically after first copy/paste
- Allow dragging from the history rather than just clicking to paste at cursor
- Provide contextual options on the history options, i.e. right-click on the item gives you options to delete it, favorite it, etc.
- Perhaps new display options with more context on where the item came from
- Flag items in the history as 'stickies' or 'favorites' so that they don't disappear
- add contextual options to the history window itself, i.e. right click on the window and there is an option to clear all non favorite items etc.",181959636

This would basically just be a block of code that writes to a file with the same information as the copy logger.

We could then merge the data, and sort based on the timestamp in order to get an accurate representation of how the extension is being used.

https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonfile

This package provides a way to read from and write to JSON, but I don't know whether it works with local files, for a browser would forbid cross domain access.",189095198
38,group7/user2,1456458948,1456459023,"Definitely possible to use this. You can write to the file when Atom closes, or even when you copy/cut and then read from it when Atom opens again or initializes.

You might want to take a look at https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html as well. It's what I'm using for the telemetry part so if you take a look at the code I've added to the telemetry, you should have an example on how to implement reading/writing to a file.

",189100678
38,group7/user2,1456459286,1456459286,"How'd you implement it would be:

1. Add the package to package.json and then run apm install.
2. Add `fs = require 'fs'` to the top of the file where you're declaring the external modules/packages being used.
3. Add the readFile function call to the init method and then populate the clipboard, and call appendFile whenever you copy something so that it's stored in the file. (Alternately there might be a shutdown or close method by Atom, and you could just copy the entire contents of the clipboard when this is called.)",189101558

next slot? Shawon Thursday 3:30-4 pm? If anybody has any conflict with
3:30-4pm, I can leave my class 10-15 min earlier on Thursday and catch the
3 pm slot.

Hey guys, Dr. Menzies had something come up during our slot for the demo,
so he moved us to 3pm on Thursday with Shaown, can everyone make this time?

I know I can but if someone else can't they should speak up with a time
that does work thats still open.

ALSO for each task we will build a spreadsheet detailing these metrics for that task so that we can come up with cool stats:
- Time to completion
- # windows switched between
- Errors?

By getting these stats we can then come up with some sort of ranking algorithm that will give us a concrete score for each package that will essentially tell us which was best (to answer that question).

Thoughts on stuff to get done today:

- Store the data we did end up collecting into the google sheet ""experimental data"". Right now that sheet is nearly empty (I just filled in some ideas on the organization, its hard to come up with a way to organize the data by participant and by task) so we will need to fill it out with relevant things to care about and fill it in with the data we collected.
- Document all of the issues we ran into when testing! This is important, we can use those issues as data points themselves in our paper, all data is data :D Not sure where the best place to do this is, maybe in an issue and then also in a google doc or something? We need something we can look at while writing the paper so the temporary existence of issues is an issue... haha... puns...

So we gave you Results, and like the outline above shows (and the name says) this is where we will actually talk about the data from our experiments (by discrete results we just mean numeric results, see the ""experimental data"" excel sheet). Also compare results here and try to find interesting correlations (i.e. it took people ~4 tasks to learn the feature then all of their speeds increased). Finally make sure to include relevant tables and graphs from our data and reference them in your discussion.

Also just as a reminder the data is all in the ""experimental data"" google sheet on drive, there are 2 sheets and the second sheet is actually where the interesting data is because it shows times per task per feature.

Finally one last note is that the person I had for control/normal definitely tried way too hard to finish quickly so her data might throw some stuff off.

Also no need to specifically call out a best feature in your results section, as the discussion section will focus more on which feature was the best, etc.

13,group7/user1,1455036620,1455037627,"Here are my thoughts on the ['Clipboard Manager'](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Clipboard%20Manager) plugin.

Install isn't too bad, you have to re-register your ctrl-c/ctrl-p (or for mac cmd-c/cmd-p) commands to use the managers commands. Once you are using their copies and pastes however it performs just like normal copy and paste; however, you can choose to show your history at the bottom of the screen like so:

![screen shot 2016-02-09 at 11 47 21 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3922117/12923245/fe09324c-cf22-11e5-8266-5f4126ec303f.png)

As you can see in the screenshot it handles indents through a special backslash, so while you can just fast copy from this box at the bottom if you want to preserve indents you must use their special commands for traversing the history and paste from that (an inconvenience). You can see where the history is currently pointed at from the big arrow on line 1.

Overall the plugin is nice but I don't like how it goes as far as to add a visual GUI component but you can only interact with it correctly through commands. This may be a larger problem with Sublime extensions on the whole though.

13,group7/user1,1455037093,1455037644,"Here are my thoughts on the ['Clipboard History'](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Clipboard%20History) plugin.

Install is way easier, don't have to remap commands it just works with your native ctrl-c/ctrl-v (or cmd-c/cmd-v) which is nice. Basically as you copy your history is build and by using a complex command (âŒ˜âŽ‡âŒƒV on mac) you can show your history and it appears in the command box at the top like so:

![screen shot 2016-02-09 at 11 55 27 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3922117/12923564/37b4404e-cf24-11e5-882f-e7fde47a60dd.png)

From here you can simply click an item and it will show up at your cursor location. Alternatively like the other plug-in you can use commands to navigate the history so your next paste pastes from the current  index. Unlike the other plugin your history doesn't stay visible as you work so you have to enter the command to see the history, then use commands to navigate and paste which is a huge pain.",181956109
13,group7/user1,1455037590,1455037897,"Here are my thoughts on the ['Jimbly's Clipboard History'](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Jimbly's%20Clipboard%20History) plugin.

So this just seems like a more updated version of the ['Clipboard History'](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Clipboard%20History) plugin with an easier command to access the clipboard history. But seriously besides that it seems identical on the surface level:

![screen shot 2016-02-09 at 12 04 34 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3922117/12923884/74bf74e4-cf25-11e5-8058-ce40b9c8555e.png)

Its last update was 8 months ago compared to the other plugins last update 3 years ago so really it just seems like the same project with a couple more recent tweaks. Same problem as before with the history not being static.

This is probably our best bet to start working from if we choose to go down the sublime route, my immediate changes to consider making would be:
- Making the history static, in other words have the history always be an active window, right now when you perform any action the history disappears 
- Having the history show automatically after first copy/paste
- Allow dragging from the history rather than just clicking to paste at cursor
- Provide contextual options on the history options, i.e. right-click on the item gives you options to delete it, favorite it, etc.
- Perhaps new display options with more context on where the item came from
- Flag items in the history as 'stickies' or 'favorites' so that they don't disappear
- add contextual options to the history window itself, i.e. right click on the window and there is an option to clear all non favorite items etc.",181959636

This would basically just be a block of code that writes to a file with the same information as the copy logger.

We could then merge the data, and sort based on the timestamp in order to get an accurate representation of how the extension is being used.

38,group7/user3,1456457114,1456498084,"I've been looking for methods of data persistence. The serialize method provided by atom applies typically to classes, while we need to store a global variable history in our case. 

https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonfile

This package provides a way to read from and write to JSON, but I don't know whether it works with local files, for a browser would forbid cross domain access.",189095198
38,group7/user2,1456458948,1456459023,"Definitely possible to use this. You can write to the file when Atom closes, or even when you copy/cut and then read from it when Atom opens again or initializes.

You might want to take a look at https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html as well. It's what I'm using for the telemetry part so if you take a look at the code I've added to the telemetry, you should have an example on how to implement reading/writing to a file.

",189100678
38,group7/user2,1456459286,1456459286,"How'd you implement it would be:

1. Add the package to package.json and then run apm install.
2. Add `fs = require 'fs'` to the top of the file where you're declaring the external modules/packages being used.
3. Add the readFile function call to the init method and then populate the clipboard, and call appendFile whenever you copy something so that it's stored in the file. (Alternately there might be a shutdown or close method by Atom, and you could just copy the entire contents of the clipboard when this is called.)",189101558

43,group7/user2,1456769774,1456769985,I just checked the calendar and it looks like the same slot (4pm on Thursday) is available with Shaown. We could always switch to that. 3pm works for me though.,190317386
43,group7/user4,1456769949,1456769949,"I have a class on Thursday at Rick's Hall which ends at 2:45 pm but it
takes some time to take wolfline bus and come to EB2. Can we choose the
next slot? Shawon Thursday 3:30-4 pm? If anybody has any conflict with
3:30-4pm, I can leave my class 10-15 min earlier on Thursday and catch the
3 pm slot.

Hey guys, Dr. Menzies had something come up during our slot for the demo,
so he moved us to 3pm on Thursday with Shaown, can everyone make this time?

I know I can but if someone else can't they should speak up with a time
that does work thats still open.

xD

Fixed, took awhile to figure out how to do this haha.

Probably taking a break for now, I think the panel is in a good place, I wish I understood the way it displays better and how panels work to make it the full height of the panel, which would help with scrolling through items. But I think its definitely demo-able now!",190834629

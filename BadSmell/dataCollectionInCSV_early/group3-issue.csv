16,Let's choose SVM as the baseline.
17,Weight Metric: tf-idf?
18,Data sets ready?
19,About Supervised Classifiers
20,We need a small demo on March 1st?
21,Code to transform the pre-processed data into numeric metrics (i.e. TF as we have discussed before).
22,Merge pull request #1 from azhe825/master
23,"Should we ignore the ""all_documents"",""_sent_mail"" folders?"
24,Preprocessed Data
25,Vector too long?
26,Alternate featurization methed: word vector?
27,Let's only take 10 emails per folder as our training data set.
28,Cleaned data
29,Simple framework 
30,Word Vector performs badly when training set is only 10 emails....
31,Supervised Classification: #1:SVM  #2:KNN(k=10)  #3:DT finished.
